# The Young Amateurs

# Act 1

## Scene 1

A silent hall, an empty stage  
A group of friends with but one thought.
"Let's do a play" is soon the cry,
And no one thinks to say "let's not".

*What sound out front  now stirs the heart?   
And strikes the bowels with consternation?   
Is that the murmur of the crowd,   
Waiting in anticipation?*

*Too late now for fond regrets,  
No turning back to days of old.  
The die is cast, our fate is sealed,   
The seats are filled, the tickets sold.*

*That pistol now  must be discharged   
Halfway through the second act.  
Evil must be foiled again,   
And once again next week in fact.*

*That secret letter intercepted    
(ruin to someone most respected);    
Oh Papa dear, what shall we do?    
Cries Maiden with a heart so true.*

*Then Villain with a black moustache      
Sneers his sneer and laughs his laugh.    
And Maiden with a heart so pure   
Knows well what she must endure!*

*But hark! Oh hark, what do I hear?   
Could those be hoof beats drawing near?  
Like coconuts on table top  
Drawing nearer, then they stop.*

*The door flies open with a bang  
(That comes a half a second late)  
And Hero bold with steely gaze   
Strides in and stands to wait... and wait.*

*Some nervous laughter then a thoughtful   
Person whispers Hero's line.   
And Villain meets his nemesis,   
The day is saved and all is fine.*

*The Merry Villagers have sung,  
The cast have made their curtain calls.  
The audience, with bottoms numb,   
Prepares to rise, the curtain falls.*


## Scene 2

**Fred:** Poor old Lindsay's going to the dogs.

**Bob:** I beg your pardon?

**Fred:** I said Lindsay's going to the dogs.

**Bob:**  Spare me, Fred, for goodness sake. It's Monday morning and
my head is fogged.

**Fred:** Why is that? You've had a day of rest to clear your head.

**Bob:** Day of rest, my foot.  The boy that pumps the church  organ has the
mumps. I had to pump the organ instead. Two services, morning and
evening. 

**Fred:** Good bracing exercise.

**Bob:** And I had two solos to sing as well. 

**Fred:** How'd you manage that?

**Bob:** Stuck my head around to sing and kept pumping. 

**Fred:** You are versatile. At least you had your afternoon.

**Bob:** I teach Sunday school. And lead the junior choir. 

**Fred:** You ought to find a nice girl and move out out of your
brother's house.  Make a life of your own, my boy. Then maybe 
he  wouldn't rope you into doing everything.

**Bob:** I'd have to move out to the Cariboo. Anyway, I like Lindsay.
We're not going to dogs. 

**Fred:** We've gotten as dull as Peterborough on a market day.

**Bob:** We can't be that bad. Dominion day this year
was a corker. We had a hot air balloon.

**Fred:** Which caught fire...and went down instead of up.

**Bob:** You can't say that wasn't exciting. 

**Fred:** Especially for the poor souls on the balloon.

**Bob:** No one was hurt. Then a torchlight parade with the fire brigade and the band.

**Fred:** Yes, yes, but that was ages ago. What we done since?
We're all growing thin and melancholy for lack of entertainment.  

**Bob:** I don't lack for entertainment.  Obadiah often reads to us from a book of sermons. 

**Fred:** Oh for the wings of a dove!

**Bob:** Sometimes my sister-in-law plays the harmonium and we sing a few hymns.

**Fred:**  Death, where is thy sting?

**Bob:** There's nothing wrong with hymns. Why after a few hymns I'm ready for... ready for...

**Fred:** Some entertainment.  The whole town is pining  for
amusement and there... there is Bell's  music hall standing dark, its
stage empty and  lifeless... but waiting.

**Bob:** Waiting?

**Fred:** Waiting. 

**Bob:** Waiting for what? *(Wary)*

**Fred:** Waiting for a pistol shot! Waiting for a scream. Waiting for song
from you, and dance from me. Waiting for a sword fight, true lovers united,
and a final chorus from the merry villagers. In short, waiting for us!

**Bob:**   Oh no. *(Starts to walk away and Fred pulls him back)* 

**Fred:** I didn't mean just you and me. No, no.  We'll get some
others to join us. We'll put on some entertainments that will
make this town stand up. 

**Bob:** And throw rotten fruit. Fred, we're amateurs.

**Fred:** We're amateurs of course! We'll call ourselves the Amateurs! Those
that love the theatre. Those that love the stage.

**Bob:** Those that work and don't get paid. This is just another of your hare-brained schemes.
 
**Fred:** Not guilty. The Professor suggested it.

**Bob:** Who is the Professor?

**Fred:** You haven't met the Professor?  He's new in town, a master musician and teacher. 

**Bob:** Uh huh. How are you going to pay for all this?

**Fred:** At present our funds amount  to  seven dollars and fifty-five cents. 

**Bob:**  A princely sum.

**Fred:** Eight dollars and fifty-five cents if you pay me the dollar
you owe me. i

**Bob:** You'll have to scrape together a little more than that for a lease on the music hall. 

**Fred:** Not to mention canvas and pots of paint
for George Wright. But we'll find the money. 

**Bob:** What's George doing?

**Fred:** The creative fire is burning in his soul. He's going to paint
our backdrops. And wait until you meet the Professor. He's a musical
genius. Straight from Leipzig, or Paris, or one of those places. 

**Bob:**  It's all very well, Fred. I have to admit it sounds like
fun.  But Obadiah would have an apoplexy if I told him I was going on
the stage. 

**Fred:**  Holy Obadiah.  

**Bob:** Yes. I can hear him now. 

Song: "Go To The Theatre"

*If you would imbibe false views,   
go to the theatre!   
Idle fancy to amuse,   
go to the theatre   
If salvation you'd refuse,   
your immortal soul you'd lose,   
Fill the Church Of Satan's pews!   
Go to the theatre!*

*If you look for lewdity,    
go to the theatre!   
Rubbish, twaddle, nudity,   
got to the theatre!   
Beelzebub will take your fees,   
Take whatever seat you please.   
Sit with Mephistopheles!   
Go to the theatre!*

*If you would pervert your taste,  
go to the theatre.   
If in hell fire you would baste,   
go to the theatre!   
Degrading and pernicious rot   
paves the road to regions hot.   
Bishop Wood says better not   
go to the theatre!*

*(Spoken)*

**Fred:** Pass by the theatre with averted gaze, for there lies the
house of the strange woman!  *(Points to upstage)*

**Bob:** It does?

**Fred:** So I understand.

**Bob:** Interesting.

*(They turn to go upstage, and then turn back to the audience)*

*(Together)*

*What's this twaddle all about?  
Step right up, remove all doubt.  
Go inside and you'll find out!  
Go to the theatre!*

*(They go off)*

## Scene

**Tempe:** I beg your pardon, Professor, but I was not flat. 

**Professor:** But my dear, by the piano...

**Tempe:** Your piano is in need of tuning. 

**Professor:** It is comparatively rare, though not unknown, for a
piano to go sharp, Tempe. In any case the piano was most carefully
tuned only two days ago.  

**Tempe:** But, but...

**Professor:** On the other hand it is comparatively common for a singer to be
flat. I don't know why that should be, but there it is.  Who are to rail
against the laws of nature? Or perhaps we should say the force of gravity.  Let
calm acceptance be our watchword.  And let us work, Tempe, work. Try it again
from the beginning.

**Tempe:** *(Stage whisper to audience)* It was the piano.

*Oh that I might chance to be    
A nightingale upon a tree  
Chirping, yodelling merrily      
Just outside your window.*

**Professor:** Warbling, Tempe, not yodelling. 

**Tempe:** I beg your pardon Professor, but I'm sure it is yodelling. 

**Professor:** Look at the words, my dear.

**Tempe:** Oh. This must be a new edition.

**Professor:** It was always warbling, Tempe. Have you ever heard a
nightingale yodel?

**Tempe:** We don't have nightingales in Canada. I don't know if they
chirp or warble. I don't know what
they do. Why can't we sing about woodpeckers, or chickadees?

**Professor:** From the beginning, Tempe, please. 

**Tempe:**

*(Struggling)*

*Oh that I might chance to be  
A nightingale upon a tree  
Chirping, warbling merrily      
Just outside your window.*

*And if awhile you did remain,  
Listening to my sad refrain,   
You I'm sure would not complain   
And loudly close your window.*

*For well you know my heart is pure  
And nothing but your love can cure  
This suffering I must endure   
While singing at your window.*  

These words don't make much sense. 

**Professor:**  Certainly not. That is what we call poetry, Tempe. By
courtesy. The words suffered a little I admit in translation from the
German.  

**Tempe:** If you say so, Professor.

**Professor:** That is our time for this week I believe.

**Tempe:** Am I getting better, Professor?

**Professor:** These things take time. 

**Tempe:** That means I'm not. 

**Professor:** Why do you want to sing, Tempe? 

**Tempe:** I don't know. Not to say it in words.  

**Professor:** I don't mean to know in words. When you know in your
heart, then you will sing well as only you can sing.

**Tempe:** Thank you, Professor. I think. 

*(Tempe leaves and Bella enters)*

**Bella:** They are all the same, these pupils. The same faults, the
same struggle. The same hopes. The same despair. 

**Professor:** No, Bella, they are all different, as every face is
different. That is the fascination of teaching. The more I travel
through this world, the more I treasure differences. 

**Bella:** And yet we are not of this world, you and I. How can we 
treasure anything? Always moving. Never holding on to anything.  

**Professor:** It is our lot, my dear sister. Let us find  what
happiness we can in passing. 

**Bella:**

*From time to time as in a dream  
I hear of things I cannot have.* 


**Professor:** Are you becoming human, Bella?

**Bella:** Is that possible?

**Professor:** It is, but not without great cost.

## Scene

**Obadiah:** Bob.  Someone has told me... I can scarcely believe it... that you intend to go upon... the stage.

**Bob:** Well, yes, Obadiah. Ah... The thought had...ah... occurred to
me. I meant to tell you. You see, Fred thought we were in need of some
harmless...

**Obadiah:** Harmless!

**Bob:** and perfectly wholesome entertainment.

**Obadiah:** Perfectly wholesome? Bob, you must be mad. Theatres
are cages of uncleanness and public schools of debauchery.  They are
seminaries of vice!

**Bob:**  How do you know that? I didn't know you had ever gone into a
theatre.

**Obadiah:** Providence forbid! No, I trust to the opinions
universally expressed by the greatest men in all ages. Men like
Augustine, and Tertullian.

**Bob:** Who were regular theatre goers?

**Obadiah:** Yes, Bob, scoff. I suppose I don't deserve anything
better.

**Bob:** Oh, Obadiah. Some harmless entertainment. What's wrong with a
little fun? 

**Obadiah:** Your immortal soul is not in need of entertainment. 

**Bob:** No but my earthly form is finding things a little dull. 

**Obadiah:** It seems all my words, the good example
I have tried to set have been cast away, while you go to disport
yourself among the heathen and the blasphemers.

**Bob:** Heathen and blasphemers? A  respectable group of amateurs,
most of them regular church-goers. And Bell's music hall.  Hardly a
palace of riot and debauchery, Obadiah. A decent and ah... virtuous
group of men and women.

**Obadiah:** Women! Heaven defend us from all the wiles of Satan!
Surely you do not propose to put women on the stage? 

**Bob:** The thought had had occurred. You see there are so many parts
for women, and if you've ever seen Fred in a wig, well it's not
something you want to see again. 

**Obadiah:** Depravity is not a joking matter. This all the result of
keeping low company. This Fred...

**Bob:** Obadiah, you've made your point. Let's  disagree, but still
be brothers. *(Bob offers Obadiah his hand, but Obadiah ignores it.
Bob walks sadly away.)*

**Obadiah:** Harmless fun. So much harm may come from harmless fun.



## Scene

**Fred:** I know that Bella sings. Does she act as well?

**Professor:** Does she act? Why she had the audience in tears when
she played "Little Pickle" in the well known play of the same name.
That was in our time in England.

**Fred:** Do you think you could persuade her to join our company? We
can't afford to pay her.

**Professor:** I'm sure she would be delighted. 

**Bella:** I know you think I'm silly. 

**Bob:** No, I...

**Bella:** There's no point in lying. I heard you talking.

**Fred:** Oh.

**Bella:** I wouldn't mind so much except...I liked you, and I thought that maybe you liked me.

**Fred:** Oh, I do. 


## Scene 

*(Just before the curtain opens)*

**Bob:** I don't think this show will ever come together.

**Sarah:** Somebody told me a bad rehearsal means a good performance.

**Fred:** Never mind everybody. It'll be all right on the night.

**Tempe:** But this is the night!

**Fred:** Oh my sainted aunt. So it is!

*(song: Stage fright)*

*Just before the curtain opens   
Just before the axe descends  
Waves of panic sweep the hearts
Of all on whom the show depends.*

*Let me think now, I can't think now  
How did I get into this? 
Please lord let a hole appear and swallow me   
How do I get out of this?*

*Stage fright, stage fright, creeping down my spine   
Churning up my insides,* 



**Professor:** Tut, tut my friends. There is no reason to be alarmed.
Each of you knows his part. Simply do it and enjoy yourselves.  



## Scene

**Obadiah:** Who are you?

**Professor:** Sometimes I hardly know myself. Say that I am a
traveller through this world. 

**Obadiah:** With no place to come to rest?

**Professor:** No. At least...

**Obadiah:** Even the swallow has found her nest.

**Professor:** Bella, you mean? Yes. She has found her nest.  And
someday... yes, for me.  For the moment I have obligations, and work
laid out for me.  A world of souls to heal, one by one, and not the
least of them, my own. A daunting task. But then we have eternity
ahead of us. 

**Obadiah:** Do we?

**Professor:** Yes. And we are not alone. Give me your blessing,
Obadiah, servant of God, and send me merrily on my way.

**Obadiah:** 

*(They shake hands)*

We will hear from you again?

**Professor:** Oh yes, from time to time. Goodbye.

*(Professor goes off leaving Obadiah alone on the stage.)*

## Scene 

*(Near end)*

**Professor:** The time has come, my dearest sister, for us to part.
For a while. You have made your choice. I cannot say that you were
wrong.

**Bella:** What is this strange feeling? *(Hugs herself as if in
pain)*

**Professor:** That is pain, Bella. It is part of being human.
