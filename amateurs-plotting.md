Because I find plotting appallingly difficult, I am setting out to
explain the matter to myself. Those who can, do. Those that can't write
self-help articles about it.

Let's give it try, however.

Defining The Plot
-----------------

A plot is a highly condensed telling of a story. It is essentially a
listing of the principal events in a story. If you keep the length of
your plot summary to let's say a thousand words, you could write fifteen
or sixteen plots in the space of one place, and eighty to one hundred in
the space of a novel.

Therefore the writing involved in writing a plot is miniscule compared
to that involved in writing out the entire story. The amount of thought
however, is likely to be proportionately greater in plotting than in
writing the complete draft.

If a play has twenty scenes, then your plot summary of one thousand
words will have an average of fifty words to give to each scene. Not
bad. That is three average sentences.

In working with the plot below I am finding that an outline of the plot
with the scenes numbered is a wonderfully stimulating way to work out a
story.

**Excercise** Add one sentence or seventeen words to each scene summary
each day until you are satisfied that you are ready to begin to write
the whole draft.

The Amateurs Plot

A group of amateurs in Lindsay Ontario in the late nineteenth century
get together to put on an operetta.

Scene

1.  Fred recruits Bob to the project. Bob is in a bad mood because his
    Sunday was not a day of rest. Bob is sceptical of the idea of
    amateur theatricals. Why does Fred think that Bob would be an
    obvious recruit? Bob loves to sing. But getting up on stage and
    doing it? They discuss Bob's brother's likely opposition. **Song:**
    Go to theatre. Point of the scene: to establish that Bob's brother
    Obadiah is opposed to many pleasant social activities including
    the theatre.

2.  Cornelia and Sarah in the kitchen of the manse. Sarah is reading a
    novel and quickly hides it when she hears someone come in. Sarah is
    obviously relieved to find that it is only Cornelia. Cornelia says
    no, it isn't Obadiah. Cornelia has a pack of cards. "Cornelia, where
    did you get those?" She wants Sarah to play a game she has learned
    from a friend. Sarah says Obadiah would not approve. **Song:** He's
    against it. Obadiah comes in time to catch the gist of what Sarah
    and Cornelia have been saying. Sarah tells Cornelia that her mother
    will be wondering where she is. Cornelia denies this, but leaves.
    Obadiah complains that Cornelia is poorly disciplined, and
    running wild. Sarah replies that Cornelia is a good girl, only with
    high spirits. Obadiah hints that he has heard some of what the
    others have been saying. Sarah tries to sooth his feelings, but he
    is hurt. Sarah asks what has become of his sense of humour. He
    replies that this world is a vale of tears, not laughter. Sarah asks
    if there will be laughter in heaven. Obadiah will not presume to
    speculate on the arrangements of the Almighty. The points to be
    established: that Sarah is deeply fond of her niece\
    Cornelia and that Sarah and Obadiah are in conflict over his very
    narrow views.

3.  Tempe's music lesson, followed by Fred and Bob interview with the
    Professor and Fiona. **Song:** Vocalese for Bob and Fiona. What
    shall we take to the stage of the music hall? How shall we brighten
    the darkness of the waning year? Fred proposes an "olio". The
    professor say they should aim higher than a mere tossed salad of
    songs and sketches. Discussion of operetta. The Professor sings
    **Song"** "Princess Myrtle" a song outlining the plot of
    the operetta. Point of the scene: to establish that the Amateurs are
    going to do an operetta not just a variety show. Also the first
    meeting of Bob and Fiona.

4.  Bob and Obadiah confrontation over the theatre. Bob says that the
    amateur theatre is a harmless amusement. Obadiah what is the world
    coming to. One righteous man.**Song:** One man of faith
    and principle. Point of the scene: to establish that Obadiah
    considers his views to be justified.

5.  Obadiah goes to confront the Professor. The Professor greets him
    kindly, but Obadiah is truculent. Obadiah tells the Professor that
    this nonsense of amateur theatre must cease. Why? Because theatre is
    the Devil's workshop. **Song:** "Dancing with the Devil". Get thee
    behind me Satan. Professor dances behind Obadiah. Obadiah leaves in
    a huff, and Fiona comes in to remonstrate with her brother. Point of
    the scene: To establish that there is something odd about The
    Professor and his sister.

6.  Rehearsal. **Song:** The Villain. Fred why am I playing the Villain?
    Tempe says that Fred is the villain through and through. No other
    possible choice. Bob is much more villainous than I could ever be.
    Especially on a Monday morning. Professor says that this Villain
    turns out in the end to be a fine fellow, only misunderstood, as his
    very moving song makes clear. Point of the scene: those who seem to
    be villains may be no such thing, if properly understood.

Tempe say if the villain is such a fine fellow why does he tie Princess
Myrtle to a railroad track? It's not a very friendly act. It shows a
lack of refinement. Just a momentary lapse, a little faux pas, says the
Professor.

7.  Fiona and Cornelia. Song Curiosity. Cornelia and Bob could sing the
    song, or Cornelia by herself. People are always saying "I
    wonder why". What is the point in asking questions, when you ask
    them of yourself? It isn't very logical, it seems to me. For if you
    knew the answers, you wouldn't have to ask. But it's simply human
    nature, it's curiosity. Human nature. Human nature. What is
    curiosity? The point of the scene: Fiona is interested in everything
    human, and wants to know what it is like to be human.

8.  George Wright working on the drops. Song Dreams of Distant Lands.
    Cornelia wants to help with the painting, but George tells her to
    leave his paints and brushes alone. You're just a kid. Point of the
    scene: to provoke Cornelia's anger and make her subsequent damage to
    the drops plausible.

9.  Bob and Fiona. The meaning of home. Home. When you feel far away,
    home is where you are far from. Home is people that you love, and
    places you remember passing day after day. Where you thought the
    same thoughts. Memories of friends you've walked with. When you have
    been someplace it is never quite the same simply because you have
    been there. This street corner will never be the same for me,
    because you have stood here. Point of the scene: Bob and Cornelia
    are falling in love.

10. Obadiah **Song:** Sleepless Night. Cornelia has gone to the theatre
    determined to show what she can do with the paints and brushes but
    she makes such a mess that she panics and brushes paint on many of
    the drops to make it look like vandalism. She then flees and runs
    into Obadiah who is coming toward the Music Hall. Obadiah goes into
    the theatre with a lamp, and is there when Fred and George arrive.
    The point of the scene: to set up a situation in which Obadiah is
    suspected of damaging the drops but cannot reveal the truth out of
    concern for Sarah.

11. Bob confronts Obadiah. Obadiah refuses to admit that he damaged the
    drops, but refuses to say who did. Bob is so angry that he moves out
    of the house. Sarah also confronts Obadiah who replies in much the
    same way as he did to Bob. **Song:** for Obadiah and Sarah. Trust.
    Sarah tells Obadiah that she is going to go along to help
    the Amateurs.

12. Cast meeting. George says we caught him red-handed!. We were right
    there. Professor asks if anybody saw Obadiah damaging the drops.
    Nobody did. George says he could just spit. Were you ever just so
    mad that you could spit? **Song:**? Sarah arrives. Bob asks what she
    is doing there. She replies that she wants to help. The Professor
    praises her, saying that's the spirit. The cast agree to say nothing
    publicly about Obadiah being caught in the music hall. Point of the
    scene: To set up the situation in which Obadiah may be drawn into
    joining the Amateurs.

13. The cast work together to repaint the drops under
    George's direction. Word gets around about the damage, and the
    community offers support. In no time the damage is repaired. George
    is recognized as a good artist, and the local newspaper runs an
    article about the operetta, and George Wright's fine painting of the
    scenery. Point of the scene: good may come from apparent evil.

Professor remarks that so often something good come out apparent
disaster. **Song:** "You never know what good good will come" And
speaking of something good coming out of disaster, says the Professor, I
must have a word with Obadiah.

14. The Professor visits Obadiah. Professor hints that Obadiah and he
    are really on the same side. Obadiah is sceptical. The Professor
    tells Obadiah that he knows that Obadiah did not damage the drops.
    He suggests that Obadiah could remove any suspicion against him by
    joining the Amateurs, saying that Sarah is taking a small role, and
    that he could do the same by playing the King, Princess
    Myrtle's father. Obadiah is reluctant, but the Professor wins him
    over by saying that Sarah would be pleased.

15. Bob and Fiona. Love scene. The meaning of things. The mystery
    of things. **Song:** The Nature Of Things. Bob tells Fiona that he
    loves her. Fiona replies that that is not possible. Bob asks why
    not. Fiona comes close to admitting her true nature to Bob, but runs
    away instead. Point: deepening the attachment of Bob and Fiona and
    leading her toward becoming human.

16. Last rehearsal. Obadiah and Sarah part of the cast. The rest of the
    cast are suspicious but Obadiah does something funny as the King.
    What? Gets a positive response from the others. Likes it.

17. Fiona becomes human and feels pain. Seamus says that pain is a part
    of being human. Seamus admits that he feels something like sadness
    at taking leave of his sister. **Song:** What lies ahead for me?
    Point: Taking leave is a part of the human experience.

18. The Night. **Song:** Stage Fright. Fiona nervous, for the first
    time. Her brother tells she is not going to die, not
    of stage-fright.

19. Performance of Princess Myrtle. **Songs:** The Hero,
    Princess Myrtle. A long scene.

20. The Professor gets Cornelia to confess that she was responsible for
    the damage to the drops. She tried to do some painting of her own,
    made a mess, and in a panic did more damage. She asks the cast for
    forgiveness, and Obadiah in particular. Obadiah says that he knew
    that Cornelia was responsible, but because she was his niece, and
    especially because of Sarah, he said nothing. Professor **song:**
    "You never know what good will come"

21. The Professor takes his leave of Obadiah. The cast are assembled on
    stage after the show. The strange woman, Sarah in a veil. Obadiah
    and Sarah united. Bob and Fiona united.

The Productivity Of Plotting
----------------------------

1.  Can write large number of words while plotting. Five to six hundred
    at a sitting. This gives you a tremendous boost of confidence in
    your ability to create a story or other piece of writing.

2.  No need to fuss. Capture ideas as they occur. No need to worry
    about wording. You can put them in wherever you think best for the
    time being, knowing that you can easily move them later. You can go
    back to any item in your outline and expand upon it as much as
    you wish.

3.  Freedom to experiment. Takes no great effort to rethink an idea or
    to change the order in which ideas appear. You can explore several
    different approaches to a scene or chapter or section in sketch
    form. You are only writing dozens of words, not thousands.

4.  One idea suggests another, because you can view all your ideas as if
    they were spread out on a table top.

5.  The evolving plot itself suggests new ideas. You can see holes or
    gaps in the plot that ought to be filled and things that have
    been neglected.

6.  The evolving plot suggests places where you can use stray ideas that
    have already occurred to you but had no obvious place. .

7.  Your outline plot allows you to work on fleshing out any scene or
    section you choose at a creative session. Your basic road map is
    laid out for you, and you can never become very lost. You could
    write a middle scene or section first, and then one toward the end.

8.  Your plot outline is a compact form of your piece that you can hold
    easily in memory and "see" as a whole.

9.  Once the plot is sketched out the major source of creative block
    is removed. The idea that you might write tens of thousands of words
    and wind up with an unusable mess is frightening and paralyzing.
    With a complete plot outline in hand you can relax and focus on the
    details of your scenes, sections, or chapters.

10. Once you start plot outlining and experience its power you will
    always begin a writing project with an outline.

11. An outline need not be highly formal or hierarchical. Don't fuss too
    much over the structure of the outline itself. It should be loose
    and fluid, just a listing of ideas, set down in the order they occur
    to you. You can rearrange them as much as you please later on.

12. Your plot outline can be changed as much as you wish at any point in
    the writing process. It is not a "straight jacket". Any idea that
    comes to you while working on the draft can easily be worked into
    the outline if wanted.

13. Starting from the same germ of an idea you could work up several
    different plot outlines and work with the one you liked the best
    when you come to writing your draft.

14. Could outlining be applied in some way to song-writing?

Boxing Day In Montreal

Using Dropbox is quite a convenience. I can write here in Montreal and
know that the material will be available when I get back to
Peterborough.

The question I am working on now that I have worked out broad outlining
is how to flesh out the skeletal ideas. Obviously I have some idea of
how to do that, but not with any great fluency. If for example you have
a scene in which you know that two characters will be discussing a
forthcoming wedding, exactly what do you have the two characters say to
each other, or do? There are a vast number of possible expansion of this
idea.

Each scene has an inner structure, not unlike that of a longer story.
There will be an introduction, a period of ferment, a mid-point
development and a movement toward a conclusion.

Each scene has a point, a purpose, a piece of information to be
conveyed. Establish that point for each scene you are working on. Go
through your outlining writing in the point you want to make in each of
your scenes.



Fri Mar 15 22:53:32 EDT 2019

I have to work out some plausible reason for Oliver to find Cornelia
painting in the music hall.

Perhaps Cornelia will quarrel with her mother and pretend to go to
bed, but will then go to the theatre. Tempe, wishing to make things up
with Cornelia will check on her and find her missing. Tempe will come
to Oliver, who is up late writing some letters, asking if Cornelia is
there. Oliver says that he will go searching for Cornelia. Tempe is
grateful and calls Oliver a good soul.
