Because I find plotting appallingly difficult, I am setting out to
explain the matter to myself. Those who can, do. Those that can't
write self-help articles about it. 

Let's give it try, however. 

## Defining The Plot

A plot is a highly condensed telling of a story. It is essentially a
listing of the principal events in a story. If you keep the length of
your plot summary to let's say a thousand words, you could write
fifteen or sixteen plots in the space of one place, and eighty to one
hundred in the space of a novel.

Therefore the writing involved in writing a plot is miniscule compared
to that involved in writing out the entire story. The amount of
thought however, is likely to be proportionately greater in plotting
than in writing the complete draft.

If a play has twenty scenes, then your plot summary of one thousand
words will have an average of fifty words to give to each scene. Not
bad. That is three average sentences.

In working with the plot below I am finding that an outline of the
plot with the scenes numbered is a wonderfully stimulating way to work
out a story.

**Excercise** Add one sentence or seventeen words to each scene
summary each day until you are satisfied that you are ready to begin
to write the whole draft.

The Amateurs Plot

A group of amateurs in Lindsay Ontario in the late nineteenth century
get together to put on an operetta. 

Scene 

1. Fred recruits Bob to the project. Bob is in a bad mood because his
   Sunday was not a day of rest. Bob is sceptical of the idea of
amateur theatricals. Why does Fred think that Bob would be an obvious
recruit? Bob loves to sing. But getting up on stage and doing it? 
 They discuss Bob's brother's likely opposition. **Song:** Go to theatre.
Point of the scene: to establish that Bob's brother Obadiah is opposed
to many pleasant social activities including the theatre.

2. Cornelia and Sarah in the kitchen of the manse. Sarah is reading a
   novel and quickly hides it when she hears someone come in. Sarah is
obviously relieved to find that it is only Cornelia. Cornelia says no,
it isn't Obadiah. Cornelia has a pack of cards. "Cornelia, where did 
you get those?" She wants Sarah to
play a game she has learned from a friend.  Sarah says Obadiah would
not approve. **Song:** He's against it. Obadiah comes in  time to
catch the gist of what Sarah and Cornelia have been saying. Sarah
tells Cornelia that her mother will be wondering where she is.
Cornelia denies this, but leaves. Obadiah  complains that Cornelia is
poorly disciplined, and running wild. Sarah replies that Cornelia is a
good girl, only with high spirits.  Obadiah hints that he has heard
some of what the others have been saying.  Sarah tries to sooth his
feelings, but he is hurt. Sarah asks what has become of his sense of
humour. He replies that this world is a vale of tears, not laughter.
Sarah asks if there will be laughter in heaven. Obadiah will not
presume to speculate on the arrangements of the Almighty.
The points to be established: that Sarah is deeply fond of her niece  
Cornelia and that Sarah and Obadiah are in conflict over his very
narrow views.


3. Tempe's music lesson, followed by Fred and Bob interview with the
   Professor and Fiona.  **Song:** Vocalese for Bob and Fiona.  What
shall we take to the stage of the music hall? How shall we brighten
the  darkness of the waning year?  Fred proposes an "olio". The
professor say they should aim higher than a mere tossed salad of songs
and sketches. Discussion of operetta. The Professor sings **Song"**
"Princess Myrtle" a song outlining the plot of the operetta. Point of
the scene: to establish that the Amateurs are going to do an operetta
not just a variety show. Also the first meeting of Bob and Fiona.

4. Bob and Obadiah confrontation over the theatre. Bob says that the
   amateur theatre is a harmless amusement. Obadiah what is the
   world coming to. One righteous man.**Song:**  One man of faith and principle. Point of the scene: to establish that Obadiah considers his views to be justified.

5. Obadiah goes to confront the Professor. The Professor greets him
   kindly, but Obadiah is truculent. Obadiah tells the Professor that
this nonsense of amateur theatre must cease. Why? Because theatre is
the Devil's workshop.  **Song:** "Dancing with the
   Devil". Get thee behind me Satan. Professor dances behind Obadiah.
Obadiah leaves in a huff, and Fiona comes in to remonstrate with her
brother. Point of the scene: To establish that there is something odd
about The Professor and his sister. 

6. Rehearsal. **Song:** The Villain. Fred why am I playing the
   Villain?  Tempe says that Fred is the villain through and through.
No other possible choice. Bob is much more villainous than I could ever
be. Especially on a Monday morning.  Professor says that this Villain
turns out in the end to be a fine fellow, only misunderstood, as his
very moving song makes clear. Point of the scene: those who seem to be
villains may be no such thing, if properly understood. 

Tempe say if the villain is such a fine fellow why does he tie Princess
Myrtle to a railroad track? It's not a very friendly act. It shows a
lack of refinement.  Just a momentary lapse, a little faux pas,
says the Professor.

7. Fiona and Cornelia. Song Curiosity. Cornelia and Bob could sing the
   song, or Cornelia by herself. People are always saying "I wonder
why". What is the point in asking questions, when you ask them of
yourself? It isn't very logical, it seems to me. For if you knew
the answers, you wouldn't have to ask. But it's simply human nature,
it's curiosity. Human nature. Human nature.  What is curiosity? The
point of the scene: Fiona is interested in everything human, and wants
to know what it is like to be human. 

8. George Wright working on the drops. Song Dreams of Distant Lands. 
Cornelia wants to help with the painting, but George tells her to
leave his paints and brushes alone. You're just a kid. Point of the
scene: to provoke Cornelia's anger and make her subsequent damage to
the drops plausible. 

9. Bob and Fiona. The meaning of home. Home. When you feel far away,
   home is where you are far from. Home is people that you love, and 
places you remember passing day after day. Where you thought the same
thoughts. Memories of friends you've walked with. When you have been 
someplace it is never quite the same simply because you have been
there. This street corner will never be the same for me, because you
have stood here. Point of the scene: Bob and Cornelia are falling in
love. 

10. Obadiah Song: Sleepless Night. Cornelia has gone to the theatre
    determined to show what she can do with the paints and brushes but
she makes such a mess that she panics and brushes paint on many of the
drops to make it look like vandalism. She then flees and runs into
Obadiah who is coming toward the Music Hall. Obadiah goes into the
theatre with a lamp, and is there when Fred and George arrive. The
point of the scene: to set up a situation in which Obadiah is
suspected of damaging the drops but cannot reveal the truth out of
concern for Sarah.

11. Bob confronts Obadiah. Obadiah refuses to admit that he damaged
    the drops, but refuses to say who did. Bob is so angry that he
moves out of the house. Sarah also confronts Obadiah who replies in
much the same way as he did to Bob. **Song:** for Obadiah and Sarah. Trust.
Sarah tells Obadiah that she is going to go along to help the
Amateurs. 

12. Cast meeting. George says we caught him red-handed!. We were right there.
Professor asks if anybody saw Obadiah damaging the drops. Nobody did. George
says he could just spit.  Were you ever just so mad that you could spit?
**Song:**?  Sarah arrives.  Bob asks what she is doing there. She replies that
she wants to help.  The Professor praises her, saying that's the spirit. The
cast agree to say nothing publicly about Obadiah being caught in the music
hall. Point of the scene: To set up the situation in which Obadiah may
be drawn into joining the Amateurs.

13. The cast work together to repaint the drops under George's
    direction. Word gets around about the damage, and the community
offers support. In no time the damage is repaired. George is
recognized as a good artist, and the local newspaper runs an article
about the operetta, and George Wright's fine painting of the scenery. 
Point of the scene: good may come from apparent evil.

Professor remarks that so often something good come out
apparent disaster. **Song:** "You never know what good good will come" 
 And speaking of something good coming out of disaster, says the
Professor, I must have a word with Obadiah. 

14. The Professor visits Obadiah. Professor hints that Obadiah and he
    are really on the same side. Obadiah is sceptical. The Professor
tells Obadiah that he knows that Obadiah did not damage the drops. He
suggests that Obadiah could remove any suspicion against him by
joining the Amateurs, saying that Sarah is taking a small role, and
that he could do the same by playing the King, Princess Myrtle's
father. Obadiah is reluctant, but the Professor wins him over by
saying that Sarah would be pleased. 

15. Bob and Fiona. Love scene. The meaning of things. The mystery of
    things.  **Song:** The Nature Of Things. Bob tells Fiona that he
loves her. Fiona replies that that is not possible. Bob asks why not.
Fiona comes close to admitting her true nature to Bob, but runs away
instead. Point: deepening the attachment of Bob and Fiona and leading
her toward becoming human.

16. Last rehearsal. Obadiah and Sarah part of the cast. The rest of
    the cast are suspicious but Obadiah does something funny as the
King. What? Gets a  positive response from the others. Likes it.

17. Fiona becomes human and feels pain. Seamus says that pain is a
    part of being human.  Seamus admits that he feels something
    like sadness at taking leave of his sister. **Song:**  What lies ahead
for me? Point: Taking leave is a part of the human experience.

18. The Night. **Song:** Stage Fright. Fiona nervous, for the first time.
    Her brother tells she is not going to die, not of stage-fright.


19. Performance of Princess Myrtle. **Songs:**  The Hero,
    Princess Myrtle.  A long scene. 

20. The Professor gets Cornelia to confess that she was responsible
    for the damage to the drops. She tried to do some painting of her
own, made a mess, and in a panic did more damage. She asks the cast
for forgiveness, and Obadiah in particular. Obadiah says that he knew
that Cornelia was responsible, but because she was his niece, and
especially because of Sarah, he said nothing. Professor **song:**
"You never know what good will come" 

20. The Professor takes his leave of Obadiah. The cast are assembled
    on stage after the show. The strange woman, Sarah in a veil.
Obadiah and Sarah united.  Bob and Fiona united. 


## The Productivity Of Plotting

1. Can write large number of words while plotting. Five to six hundred
   at a sitting. This gives you a tremendous boost of confidence in
your ability to create a story or other piece of writing.

2. No need to fuss. Capture ideas as they occur. No need to worry
   about wording. You can put them in wherever you think best for the
time being, knowing that you can easily move them later. You can go back 
to any item in your outline and expand upon it as much as you wish.

3. Freedom to experiment. Takes no great effort to rethink an idea or
to change the order in which ideas appear. You can explore several
different approaches to a scene or chapter or section in sketch form.
You are only writing dozens of words, not thousands. 

4. One idea suggests another, because you can view all your ideas as
   if they were spread out on a table top.

5. The evolving plot itself suggests new ideas. You can see holes or
   gaps in the plot that ought to be filled and things that have been
neglected.

6. The evolving plot suggests places where you can use stray ideas that
   have already occurred to you but had no obvious place. .

7. Your outline plot allows you to work on fleshing out any scene or
   section you choose at a creative session. Your basic road map is
laid out for you, and you can never become very lost. You could write
a middle scene or section first, and then one toward the end. 

8. Your plot outline is a compact form of your piece that you can hold
   easily in memory and "see" as a whole.

9. Once the plot is sketched out the major source of creative block is
   removed. The idea that you might write tens of thousands of words
and wind up with an unusable  mess is frightening and paralyzing. With
a complete plot outline in hand you can relax and focus on the details
of your scenes, sections, or chapters. 

10. Once you start plot outlining and experience its power you will
    always begin a writing project with an outline.

11. An outline need not be highly formal or hierarchical. Don't fuss
    too much over the structure of the outline itself. It should be
loose and fluid, just a listing of ideas, set down in the order they
occur to you. You can rearrange them as much as you please later on.

12. Your plot outline can be changed as much as you wish at any point
    in the writing process. It is not a "straight jacket". Any idea 
that comes to you while working on the draft can easily be worked into
the outline if wanted.

13. Starting from the same germ of an idea you could work up several
    different plot outlines and work with the one you liked the best
when you come to writing your draft.

14. Could outlining be applied in some way to song-writing?

Boxing Day In Montreal

Using Dropbox is quite a convenience. I can write here in Montreal and
know that the material will be available when I get back to
Peterborough. 

The question I am working on now that I have worked out broad
outlining is how to flesh out the skeletal ideas. Obviously I have
some idea of how to do that, but not with any great fluency. If for
example you have a scene in which you know that two characters will be
discussing a forthcoming wedding, exactly what do you have the two
characters say to each other, or do? There are a vast number of
possible expansion of this idea.

Each scene has an inner structure, not unlike that of a longer story.
There will be an introduction, a period of ferment, a mid-point
development and a movement toward a conclusion.

Each scene has a point, a purpose, a piece of information to be
conveyed. Establish that point for each scene you are working on. Go
through your outlining writing in the point you want to make in each
of your scenes.
