<p><strong>Fred:</strong> You have a dab of paint on your nose, George.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> What? Oh. <em>(goes on painting)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> And a lot in your hair. I hope you're getting some on the canvas too.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> What's that supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> What do you mean, what's it supposed to be? What does it look like? <em>(Goes back to painting)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> It looks like a woman. Is it your mother?</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> <em>(Annoyed)</em> No it's not my mother.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Why it's the Queen, to be sure. Victoria herself as if she could step out of the canvas and give us all a knighthood. A fine loyal gesture, George, to give Her Majesty pride of place.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> Thanks, Professor. Nice to know there's someone around here that isn't blind as a bat. <em>(Glares at Fred)</em></p>
<p><em>(The Professor winks at Fred, who shrugs and walks away)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cornelia:</strong> Can I paint a little, George? I can do a sheep. A big blog of white for the body, a little blob for the head...</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> No you can't, Cornelia, and leave my brushes alone. Anyways, I'm almost done this drop. If wasn't for all these amateurs... I'd be done long since.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> Shouldn't the sky be a little bluer?</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> No it shouldn't. The sky's not blue at the horizon. Nearer a dust colour, if you use the eyes the Good Lord give you!</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> That house up on the hill should be a little bigger, don't you think? And the roof a brighter red?</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> It looks just fine the way it is, for...oh, never mind!</p>
<p><em>(Song for George. &quot;Everybody's Got An Opinion&quot;)</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody's got an opinion, everybody's got to have their say.</em><br />
<em>Everybody's got to shove their oars in, butting in and getting in the way.</em><br />
<em>Everyone knows better how to do a job of work than the man who's got to do that job of work.</em><br />
<em>What with all the helpful offers of advice it's a wonder that I haven't gone berserk.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't claim to be a fancy painter, I've never been to Paris or to France</em><br />
<em>Or none of those places that the other painters go and I doubt if I'll ever have the chance.</em><br />
<em>I'll go on working in the paint and paper store, and I'll paint Sunday afternoons instead,</em><br />
<em>But paint you know I must, I just have to paint or bust.</em><br />
<em>With these colours dancing in my head.</em><br />
<em>Just give a man some leeway, then I'll make some headway,</em><br />
<em>And I'll show you all what George Wright has to say.</em><br />
<em>And I'll be a real painter, hanging in a gallery,</em><br />
<em>They will say that I'm an painter some day.</em></p>
