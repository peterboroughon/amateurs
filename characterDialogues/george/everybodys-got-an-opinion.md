**Fred:**  You have a dab of paint on your nose, George. 

**George:** What? Oh. *(goes on painting)*

**Fred:**  And a lot in your hair. I hope you're getting some on the 
canvas too. 

**George:** Ha, ha.

**Fred:** What's that supposed to be?

**George:** What do you mean, what's it supposed to be? What does it
look like? *(Goes back to painting)*

**Fred:** It looks like a woman. Is it your mother?

**George:** *(Annoyed)* No it's not my mother.

**Professor:** Why it's the Queen, to be sure. Victoria herself as
if she could step out of the canvas and give us all a knighthood. 
A fine loyal gesture, George, to give Her Majesty pride of place. 

**George:** Thanks, Professor. Nice to know there's someone around 
here that isn't blind as a bat. *(Glares at Fred)* 

*(The Professor winks at Fred, who shrugs and walks away)*

**Cornelia:** Can I paint a little, George? I can do a sheep. A big 
blog of white for the body, a little blob for the head...

**George:** No you can't, Cornelia, and leave my brushes alone.
Anyways, I'm almost done this drop. If wasn't for all these
amateurs... I'd be done long since.

**Tempe:** Shouldn't the sky be a little bluer?

**George:** No it shouldn't. The sky's not blue at the horizon. Nearer
a dust colour, if you use the eyes the Good Lord give you!

**Bob:** That house up on the hill should be a little bigger, don't
you think? And the roof a brighter red?

**George:** It looks just fine the way it is, for...oh, never mind!

*(Song for George. "Everybody's Got An Opinion")*

*Everybody's got an opinion, everybody's got to have their say.*  
*Everybody's got to shove their oars in, butting in and getting in the
way.*  
*Everyone knows better how to do a job of work than the man who's got
to do that job of work.*   
*What with all the helpful offers of advice it's a wonder that I
haven't gone berserk.*  

*I don't claim to be a fancy painter, I've never been to Paris or to
France*   
*Or none of those places that the other painters go and I doubt if I'll
ever have the chance.*  
*I'll go on working in the paint and paper store, and I'll paint 
Sunday afternoons instead,*   
*But paint you know I must, I just have to paint or bust.*  
*With these colours dancing in my head.*  
*Just give a man some leeway, then I'll make some headway,*   
*And I'll show you all what George Wright has to say.*  
*And I'll be a real painter, hanging in a gallery,*  
*They will say that I'm an painter some day.*
