**Bella:** You must be kind to your sister, Cornelia.

**Cornelia:** Why? She isn't kind to me.

**Bella:** I think she means to be. But you do provoke her, sometimes.

**Cornelia:** To see what will happen? I suppose I do. It's natural
human curiosity.

**Bella:** Human? Curiosity? What is curiosity?

**Cornelia:** How can you not know what curiosity is? Even cats know
that.

**Bella:** Tell me anyway, Cornelia, please.

Song: Curiosity

*When you look into the water,  
Wondering what might be there  

How things come to be
That's curiosity.

There is a very real paucity 
of words that rhyme with curiosity.
