**Bob:** Hey, kid. Can you get the jewel box from the table
downstairs?

**Cornelia:** My name is Cornelia. As a point of information.

**Bob:** Oh, sorry. Cornelia can you get the box?

**Cornelia:** Of course I can, when I'm asked nicely.

**Tempe:** Don't sauce your elders, Cornelia.

**Cornelia:** Not if they return the favour.

**Professor:** Very good, very good.
