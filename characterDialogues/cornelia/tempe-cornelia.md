**Cornelia:** The Professor is going to give me a song. He says I sing
as well as you do.

**Tempe:** What? I'm sure he said no such thing. 

**Cornelia:** Well, not in so many words. 

**Tempe:** Not in any words at all. Why you have no training, no
technique. you never practise. You don't even read music. 

**Cornelia:** I'm going to learn. And the Professor said I have a
natural gift and if I apply myself... one day I will sings as well as
you do.

**Tempe:** One day. That's sounds more likely.

**Cornelia:** Or even better.

**Tempe:** Not if you bite into a poisoned apple before then, my
pretty.

**Cornelia:** Mother would never forgive you.

**Tempe:** I might risk it.
