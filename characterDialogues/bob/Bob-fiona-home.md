# Bob and Fiona -- Home

**Bob:** Where is home for you, Fiona?

**Fiona:** Home? I don't know. 

**Bob:** I mean, if you went home to visit, where would you go?

**Fiona:** What do you mean by "home"?

**Bob:** Why it's hard to put into words, but everybody knows what
home means. 

**Fiona:** I don't.

**Bob:** 

*When you're feeling far away, 
Someplace you don't belong,
Far away for far too long.
The place that you've been far way from 
Far too long is home.
