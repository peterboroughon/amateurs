**Professor:** And now my friends, what shall the play be?

**Fred:** I thought perhaps we could do a few songs, tell a few jokes,
you know the sort of thing.

**Professor:** I know the sort of thing. But it seems a shame not to
spread our wings a little.

**Bob:** What do you mean, Professor?

**Professor:** Well... I thought something a little more formal,
something with a little meat to it, if you see what I mean.

**Fred:** But it would have to have some jokes.

**Bob:** And it would have to have some songs.

**Cornelia:** But something with a real story to it.

**Tempe:** An operetta!

**Professor:** Yes, exactly, Tempe. An operetta.

**George:** Ah that sounds more like it. Snow topped mountains, and
castles, and pretty villages.  What operetta?

**Tempe:** Something by Offenbach?

**Professor:** It might be expensive to get the music. And no one in
Lindsay is likely to understand French. However, I do have a little
something called "Princess Myrtle" that will be quite suitable I
think. 

**George:** Are there mountains and castles?

**Professor:** Any number of them. And walled gardens, and cottage
dooryards.  Almost unlimited scope for the painter.

**Cornelia:** What is it about?

**Professor:**

Oh the usual sort of thing.
