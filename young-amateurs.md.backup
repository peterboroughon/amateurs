# The Young Amateurs

# Act 1

## Prologue

**Professor:** *(With old newspaper in hand)*  The Lindsay Post of
1876 announced the re-opening of Bell's Music Hall. 

*(Clears throat
and reads)* 

"The Young Amateurs have leased the building and propose
giving some six or eight entertainments. George Wright has painted
eight backdrops and a landsscape curtain...surmounted by a picture of
her Majesty, Queen Victoria". 

Beginning with this tiny  bit of thread
we weave a fantasy, and if you don't like it, why God bless you, yea
from generation unto generation.

*(Oliver comes on)*

**Oliver:**
*A silent hall, an empty stage  
A group of friends with but one thought.    
"Let's do a play" is soon the cry,  
And no one thinks to say "let's not".*

*(Bob comes on)*

**Bob:**
*What sound out front now stirs the heart?   
And strikes the bowels with consternation?   
Is that the murmur of the crowd,   
Waiting in anticipation?*

*(Fiona comes on)*

**Fiona:**

*Too late now for fond regrets,  
No turning back to days of old.  
The die is cast, our fate is sealed,   
The seats are filled, the tickets sold.*

*(Cornelia comes out)*

**Cornelia:**

*That pistol now  must be discharged   
Halfway through the second act.  
Evil must be foiled again,   
And once again next week in fact.*

*(Tempe comes out)*

**Tempe:**

*That secret letter intercepted    
(Ruin to someone most respected);    
Oh Papa dear, what shall we do?    
Cries Maiden with a heart so true.*

**Fred:**

*Then Villain with a black moustache      
Sneers his sneer and laughs his laugh.    
And Maiden with a heart so pure   
Knows well what she must endure!*

**George:**

*But hark! Oh hark, what do I hear?   
Could those be hoof beats drawing near?  
Like coconuts on table top  
Drawing nearer, then they stop.*

**Bob:**

*The door flies open with a bang  
(That comes a half a second late)  
And Hero bold with steely gaze   
Strides in and stands and waits... and waits.*

**Professor:**

*Some nervous laughter then a thoughtful   
Person whispers Hero's line.   
And Villain meets his nemesis,   
The day is saved and all is fine.*

**Cornelia:**

*The Merry Villagers have sung,  
The cast have made their curtain calls.  
The audience, with bottoms numb,   
Prepares to rise, the curtain falls.*


*(All except Fred and Bob go off)*

## Scene 1

**Fred:** Well, Bob.  what do you think?

**Bob:** I think this is just  another of your hare-brained schemes.

**Fred:** Hare-brained?  There's Bell's music hall standing
empty...empty and waiting.

**Bob:** Uh huh. It won't hurt it to wait some more.

**Fred:** Don't you think it's an awful shame? Where's your civic
pride?  What's the use of a music hall without music?  

**Bob:** A good warehouse. We've got some things it right now. 

**Fred:**
Just the
other day I heard a man  saying that someone should take that place
in hand and do something with it.

**Bob:** That man  was probably you. Why you listen to yourself, I
don't know. I never do. Look, Fred, it's Monday morning and...

**Fred:** And here's Lindsay pining away for lack of entertainment.

**Bob:** I don't think Lindsay is pining away to see us on the stage.

**Fred:** They loved us at the Canoe Club last month.

**Bob:** With the amount of brandy you slipped into the punch, they'd
have loved anything. 

**Fred:** A tumbler full, that's all.

**Bob:**
It's one thing to do a few songs
and barnyard noises for inebriated friends, it's another to hold an
audience for a couple of hours. I mean a cold sober audience.

**Fred:** Your brother does it every Sunday. Cold and sober.  

**Bob:** Ollie's never preached for two hours.

**Fred:** Just seems like it?

**Bob:**  How would you know? You've only darkened the doors of our
church once or twice in my memory.

**Fred:** All right, all right. But what about the
music hall? You're not just afraid of what your evangelical brother
would say?

**Bob:** Certainly not! What do you take me for? 

**Fred:** A man of independence and iron will!

**Bob:** Absolutely!  Actually... Ollie would have an apoplexy if he
found out that I was doing amateur theatricals. 

**Fred:** Or preach you a red hot sermon.

**Bob:**  Or that. Probably that.  I can just hear him now. *(Holds head
and shakes it)*

Song: "Go To The Theatre"

*If you would imbibe false views,   
go to the theatre!   
Idle fancy to amuse,   
go to the theatre.   
If salvation you'd refuse,   
your immortal soul you'd lose,   
Fill the Church Of Satan's pews!   
Go to the theatre!*

*If you look for lewdity,    
go to the theatre!   
Rubbish, twaddle, nudity,   
got to the theatre!   
Beelzebub will take your fees,   
Take whatever seat you please.   
Sit with Mephistopheles!   
Go to the theatre!*

*If you would pervert your taste,  
go to the theatre.   
If in hell fire you would baste,   
go to the theatre!   
Degrading and pernicious rot   
paves the road to regions hot.   
Bishop Wood says better not   
go to the theatre!*

*(Spoken)*

**Fred:** Pass by the theatre with averted gaze, for there lies the
house of the strange woman!  *(Points to upstage)*

**Bob:** It does?

**Fred:** So I understand.

**Bob:** Interesting.

*(They turn to go upstage, and then turn back to the audience)*

*(Together)*

*What's this twaddle all about?  
Step right up, remove all doubt.  
Go inside and you'll find out!  
Go to the theatre!*

**Fred:** Go to the theatre?

**Bob:** We'll see.

**Fred:** Wait until you meet the Professor.

**Bob:** Who is the Professor?

## Scene 2

*(In the kitchen of the manse. Sarah is sitting at a table. There is 
another chair at the table as well. Sarah is reading from a book.)*

**Sarah:** *(Reading)*
"On his own account, and, I must be allowed to add, on mine also, the
Professor merits the honour of a formal introduction. Accident has
made him the starting-point of the strange family story which it is
the purpose of these pages to unfold."

*(There is a heavy footfall, and Sarah starts and tries to hide the
book in her dress. Cornelia comes in.)*

Oh, Cornelia. It's you. 


**Cornelia:** Yes. just little me. Sorry if I made a bit of a thump.
Did you think it was my uncle?

**Sarah:** No. Well, I supposed it might have been. Look at the time.
I ought to put the kettle on.

**Cornelia:** What are you hiding there? 

*(Goes to Sarah and takes the book)*

Ooh ooh. *The Woman In White*. Wilkie Collins. Work of the Devil,
Aunt Sarah. Work of the devil. *(Wags her finger at Sarah)*

**Sarah:** You're a little Devil, Cornelia. Don't mock your uncle,
dear. It hurts me when you do.

**Cornelia:** I'm sorry. I'll try to behave. That's my mother's book
isn't?

**Sarah:** Yes. She said it was very good, but I don't think it is 
quite the kind of book...

**Cornelia:** That Uncle Oliver would approve of. What does that
matter. Why should you be afraid to read a book in your own
kitchen? 

**Sarah:** I'm not afraid. But I have to respect my husband's wishes.

**Cornelia:** Or pretend to, and then do what you really want to do in
secret. 

**Sarah:** Cornelia!

**Cornelia:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

**Sarah:** When you get older, you'll understand. There are things a
woman has to do.

**Cornelia:** When I get older, I won't have to understand. I don't
believe I'll get married.  All the boys I know are pitiful. There isn't
one of them I can't beat in an arm wrestle. Except Peter. I got him
with a kick instead.

**Sarah:** Cornelia!

**Cornelia:** You have to know just where to kick them.

**Sarah:** Cornelia! That isn't fair.

**Cornelia:** If you can win fair and square, do so. If you can't,
then cheat.

**Sarah:** Cornelia! *(Laughs)* What are we going to do with you?

**Cornelia:** Nothing at all. I'm just fine the way I am. The question
is what are we going to do with Uncle Oliver?

**Sarah:** What do you mean? 


**Cornelia:**

*If there's anything at all that  you really  like to do,
He's against it.*

**Sarah:**

*Oh  Cornelia you know  that's a little bit unfair, 
Now admit it.*

**Cornelia:**

It's not at all unfair, I don't admit it
If it's any fun at all, he's against it.
Don't bother to inquire, he's against it.
Anything a body might enjoy, he's against it.

He has reason to suspect you might adore it,
He'll deplore it, he's not for it.

**Sarah:**

It's true, it's true. I'm sad to say it's true.

If the evening's dragging on and you're feeling rather dull,
And you find that you are glancing at the clock (not quite bedtime)
For the conversation hit a lull some forty minutes back
And thank goodness you can knit or darn a sock

**Cornelia:**

*You might want to sing a song that isn't from the hymn-book,  
If the music is profane, he won't have it.   
You might want to play a game, any you can name,  
but the answer's still the same, he's against it.*

**Sarah:**
*Your uncle used to be quite a lot of fun, (I don't believe it)  
In a dignified and proper kind of way,  
And it wasn't very hard to get a chuckle out of him,  
Over something I would read or I would say.*

*Who can say why people change?


*(Oliver comes in. Cornelia quickly takes the book from Sarah and
holds it casually by her side.)*

**Oliver:** Cornelia. Why aren't you in school?

**Cornelia:** School's out, Uncle. It's almost five o'clock.

**Oliver:** So it is. I had quite lost track of time. Well then
you should be getting home. It must be near your supper time.

**Cornelia:** Not until six o'clock. If Mother isn't late from her
singing lesson. Then it might be later. 

**Oliver:** Singing lessons, for a woman her age. A waste of time and
money. And singing profane music, no doubt. It would be different of
course if she were singing sacred music. 

**Sarah:** Tempe has sung for us from time to time. You said yourself
Oliver, how well she sings.  Cornelia, perhaps it is time for you to
go home.

**Oliver:** What is that book, Cornelia? Show it to me.

**Cornelia:** You wouldn't be interested, Uncle.

**Oliver:** You might allow me to be the judge of that. Show it to
me.

*(Cornelia reluctantly gives Oliver the book)*

**Oliver:** Wilkie Collins. The Woman In White. I have heard of this
abomination. It should be burned. Open the stove.

**Sarah:** No, Oliver. 

**Cornelia:** That's my mother's book. Give it back to me.

**Sarah:** Cornelia is right, Oliver. It's Tempe's book.

**Oliver:** Very well, but take it out of my house immediately. And
don't bring it back, or I will burn it.

*(Cornelia runs off with the book)*

A girl that age reading a book like that?  And she runs around the
town absolutely uncontrolled and unchaperoned, and who knows what
trouble she's getting into?  She's running wild.

**Sarah:** Cornelia is high-spirited.

**Oliver:** Is that what you call it?

**Sarah:** Certainly. What would you call it?

**Oliver:** It's a shame she lost her father. She needs a firm
guidance.  

**Sarah:** He left them well provided for. And Tempe does her best.

**Oliver:** Tempe might as well not be there. She isn't any older,
mentally, than Cornelia.  The way those two squabble. They might be
sisters, not mother and daughter. Now if Cornelia was a child of mine...

**Sarah:** Or mine. 

**Oliver:** What was that?

**Sarah:** Nothing.

*(Sarah sighs)*

**Oliver:** Why do you sigh, my dear? Are you unwell?

**Sarah:** Low in spirits, Oliver.

**Oliver:** Shall we call for the doctor?

**Sarah:** I don't need medicine, Oliver. I need a reason to smile. I 
need a little laughter in my life. 

**Oliver:** Life is a serious business, Sarah. Surely you understand
that as well as anyone?

**Sarah:** Serious but why must it be grim? 

**Oliver:** Is life with me...grim?

**Sarah:** Not exactly Oliver, but...

**Oliver:** But?

**Sarah:** I wish that we could laugh together over little things,



## Scene 3

**Tempe:** I beg your pardon, Professor, but I was not flat. 

**Professor:** But my dear, by the piano...

**Tempe:** Your piano is out of tune. 

**Professor:** It is rare for a piano to go sharp, Tempe. In any case
the piano was most carefully tuned only two days ago.  

**Tempe:** But, but...

**Professor:** On the other hand it is common for a singer to be flat.
I don't know why that should be, but there it is. Perhaps it is the
force of gravity.  Try it again from the beginning.

**Tempe:** *(Stage whisper to audience)* It was the piano.

*Oh that I might chance to be    
A nightingale upon a tree  
Chirping, yodelling merrily      
Just outside your window.*

**Professor:** Warbling, Tempe, not yodelling. 

**Tempe:** I beg your pardon Professor, but I'm sure it is yodelling. 

**Professor:** Look at the words, my dear.

**Tempe:** Oh. This must be a new edition.

**Professor:** It was always warbling, Tempe. Have you ever heard a
nightingale yodel?

**Tempe:** We don't have nightingales in Canada. I don't know if they
chirp or warble. I don't know what they do. Why can't we sing about
woodpeckers, or chickadees?

**Professor:**  Canada is a very uninspiring country. Nobody writes
songs about it. From the beginning, Tempe, please. 

**Tempe:**

*(Struggling)*

*Oh that I might chance to be  
A nightingale upon a tree  
Chirping, warbling merrily      
Just outside your window.*

*And if awhile you did remain,  
Listening to my sad refrain,   
You I'm sure would not complain   
And loudly close your window.*

*For well you know my heart is pure  
And nothing but your love can cure  
This suffering I must endure   
While singing at your window.*  

From Princess Myrtle. What is Princess Myrtle?

**Professor:** It is a comic opera. 

**Tempe:** The words don't make much sense. 

**Professor:** The words of songs, poetry, the remarks of theatre
critics and so on...we don't expect these classes of  things to make
sense, Tempe. It wouldn't be fair. 

**Tempe:** If you say so, Professor.

**Professor:** That is our time for this week I believe.

**Tempe:** Am I getting better, Professor?

**Professor:** These things take time. 

**Tempe:** That means I'm not. 

**Professor:** Why do you want to sing, Tempe? 

**Tempe:** I don't know. Not to say it in words.  

**Professor:** I don't mean to know in words. When you know in your
heart, then you will sing well as you can sing.

**Tempe:** Thank you, Professor. I think. 

*(Tempe leaves and Fiona enters)*

**Fiona:** They are all the same, these pupils. The same faults, the
same struggle. The same hopes. The same despair. 

**Professor:** No, Fiona, they are all different, as every face is
different. That is the fascination of teaching. The more I travel
through this world, the more I treasure differences. 

**Fiona:** And yet we are not quite  of this world, you and I. How can we 
treasure anything? Ever moving. Never holding on to anything.  

**Professor:** It is our lot, my dear sister. Let us find  what
interest  we can in the  passing scene, we wandering ones. And
remember we are not without purpose in our existence.  

**Fiona:**

Seamus. What is love?

**Professor:** 

Love?

Love is an emotion. Love is an attachment. It binds you to a person,
or a  one place, or pulls you somewhere else.  Why it is...difficult
to define exactly. 

**Fiona:**


**Professor:**

With love comes grief, and loneliness... and pain.  Burdens we are
spared in our existence. I would rather have serenity.

*(The doorbell rings)*

Ah, that may be our young friends, the Amateurs. Would you go and see
them in, Fiona?

**Fiona:** 

The what?

**Professor:** 

The Young Amateurs. So they call themselves, I understand. 

*(Fiona goes off while the Professor shuffles through some music.
Fiona returns with Fred and Bob)*

**Fiona:** Through here, please.

**Professor:**
Ah, gentlemen. Welcome, welcome. 

*(Fred looks around with interest at the room, while Bob looks with
interest at Fiona.)*

**Fred:** Thanks Professor. I've brought my friend Bob along. I told
you about Bob. The one that can carry a tune. 

**Professor:** Indeed you did. *(Notices Bob looking at Fiona)* Oh,
may I present my sister, Fiona. 

**Fred:** Pleased to meet you.

**Bob:** Fion...?.

**Fiona:** Fiona.

**Professor:** So, you can carry a tune, Bob?

**Bob:** In a bucket. 

**Professor:** Modesty is a virtue. 

**Bob:** And honesty a greater one.

**Professor:** Perhaps. 

**Fred:** Sing? Why he knocked them dead at the canoe club.

**Bob:** That's right. There were no survivors.

**Professor:** Let's try a little vocalizing. Are a tenor, a baritone?

**Bob:** Neither. I'm  a baptist. 

**Professor:** A baptist with a sense of humour. Every day brings its
novelty. Bob, just follow Fiona. Musically, I mean. 

*(The Professor plays the introduction to the vocalization)*

*(Fiona and Bob sing the Vocalese)*

**Professor:** Perfect. Now what will the play be? What shall we put on?

**Fred:** Well you know, I thought a little of this, a little of that.
A song, a story, a few jokes, some barnyard imitations... you know.
What they call an olio.

**Professor:** An olio. Well, I think we can aim a little higher than
that. What do you say to a  comic operetta?

**Bob:** That's a bit ambitious, isn't it? 

**Professor:** Ambitious, certainly. Though the piece I have in
mind... one of my own composing... is modest enough in its demands. A 
king, a queen, a castle,  a princess in distress, a villain, a hero. 
It is entitled...Princess Myrtle!  And Bob, you are the very image of
the Hero. 

**Fred:** What about me? This whole thing was my idea.

**Professor:** Ah, Fred, for you I suggest the meatiest part of all...
the Villain!.

**Bob:** The perfect choice, Professor. Will Miss Fiona...?

**Professor:** I believe she will take the part of the lady in
waiting. 

**Bob:** Not the princess?

**Professor:** Ah. Our princess must be a lady of strong presence and
forceful character. I believe our very own Tempe will 
be a marvellous Princess Myrtle. 

**Bob and Fred:** *(Together)* Tempe?

## Scene 4

**Oliver:** Bob.  Someone has told me... I can scarcely believe it... that you intend to go upon... the stage.

**Bob:** Well, yes, Oliver. As a matter of fact,  ah... the thought
had...ah... occurred to me. I meant to tell you. You see, Fred thought
we were in need of some harmless...

**Oliver:** Harmless!

**Bob:** and perfectly wholesome entertainment.

**Oliver:** Perfectly wholesome? Bob, you must be mad. Theatres
are cages of uncleanness and public schools of debauchery.  They are
seminaries of vice!

**Bob:**  How did you discover that? I didn't know you had ever gone into a
theatre.

**Oliver:** Providence forbid! No, I trust to the opinions
universally expressed by the greatest men in all ages. Men like
Augustine, and Tertullian.

**Bob:** Who were regular theatre goers?

**Oliver:** Yes, Bob, scoff. I suppose I don't deserve anything
better.

**Bob:** Oh, Oliver. Some harmless entertainment. What's wrong with a
little fun? 

**Oliver:** Your immortal soul is not in need of entertainment. 

**Bob:** No but my earthly form is finding things a little dull. 

**Oliver:** It seems all my words, the good example
I have tried to set have been cast away, while you go to disport
yourself among the heathen and the blasphemers.

**Bob:** Heathen and blasphemers? A respectable group of amateurs...  well all
right, there's Fred, but the rest of them are respectable. And Bell's music
hall.  Hardly a palace of riot and debauchery, Oliver. A decent and ah...
virtuous group of men and women.

**Oliver:** Women! Heaven defend us from all the wiles of Satan!
Surely you do not propose to put women on the stage? 

**Bob:** The thought had had occurred. You see there are so many parts
for women, and if you've ever seen Fred in a wig, well it's not
something you want to see again. 

**Oliver:** Depravity is not a joking matter. This all the result of
keeping low company. This Fred...

**Bob:** Oliver, you've made your point. Let's  disagree, but still
be brothers. *(Bob offers Oliver his hand, but Oliver ignores it.
Bob walks sadly away.)*

**Oliver:** Harmless fun. So much harm may come from harmless fun.


## Scene 5 *(Oliver goes to confront the Professor)*

**Oliver:** Good day to you, Miss. Is your brother at home?

**Fiona:** You wish to speak with him?

**Oliver:** That I do.

**Fiona:** I will see if he is at home.

**Oliver:** Don't you know if he is at home?

**Fiona:** At home to one like you I mean.

**Oliver:** What do you mean by that, may I ask?

**Fiona:** You carry a dark cloud with you. A cloud of anger 
and distress. It is not pleasant to encounter such a cloud. Do you seek
my brother's help?

**Oliver:** I most certainly do not.  I have a serious complaint to
raise with him.

**Fiona:** I go and see.

**Professor:** No need, no need, Fiona. Speak of the Devil and he 
appears. I believe that is the jocular expression, is it not Mr.
Allen?

**Oliver:** I don't care for jokes aoese amateur theatricals.

*(Fiona goes off)*


## Scene 6

*(Rehearsal. **Song:** All we have to do is make every body happy)*

**Fred:** I know that Fiona sings. Does she act as well?

**Professor:** Does she act? Why she had the audience in tears when
she played "Little Pickle" in the well known play of the same name.
That was in our time in England.

**Fred:** Do you think you could persuade her to join our company? We
can't afford to pay her.

**Professor:** I'm sure she would be delighted. 

**Fred:** What part might we give her, do you suppose? I thinking of
the Princess Myrtle.

**Professor:** But our good friend Tempe has been singing the part 
in rehearsal. 

**Fred:** But the princess ought to be so, so... and Tempe is so,
so...

**Professor:** Tempe would be terribly disappointed to have it taken 
away from her.

**Fred:** What importance is the disappointment of one when the needs
of art are question?

**Professor:** What importance are the needs of art when the
disappointment of one is in question?

**Fred:** You are a curious man, Professor.  I thought you would place
art above everything.

**Professor:** There are many arts that one can practise, Fred. Fiona 
would be charming as the maid. A comic part and one good song. 

**Fred:** All right, Professor. You know best.


## Scene 7

*(Painting the drops. Song for Cornelia: Curiosity)*

**Cornelia:** Painted castles are all right, but somewhere
there are real castles. Have you ever seen a real castle,
Miss?

**Fiona:** Yes, many times. 

**Cornelia:** You have? Are they beautiful?

**Fiona:** I don't know. I suppose perhaps some are. 

**Cornelia:** Where did you see castles?

**Fiona:** Oh, in Europe. 

**Cornelia:** What were you doing in Europe?

**Tempe:** Cornelia. Don't pester people with questions.

**Cornelia:** I can't help it, Mother. Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to live in a Castle, in the olden days? When there were
knights in armour?

**Fiona:** No. Wondering. Wondering.  Is wondering something you do?

**Tempe:** Wondering is something my daughter does a lot of. I 
never knew a girl so full of curiosity.

**Fiona:** Curiosity? What is curiosity?

**Cornelia:** You don't know what curiosity is? 

**Tempe:** Cornelia. Remember that Miss Allen is a foreigner.

**Cornelia:** Oh, that's right. Well, let's see...

*How to describe this thing called curiosity,
There is a mystery, for there is a paucity
of words that say exactly what it ought to be,
But it means that you want to know.*

*How to describe that feeling  
When you look up and see   
How the sky is coloured blue,  
and wonder how it came to be.*

*Just look around and see how strange the world can be,  
There is so much to see, so many oddities.  
So much to waken someone's curiosity,  
It makes you want to know.*

*How do those little creatures 
Go walking with so many feet?  
And how do they get their boots done up?  
I must admit it has me beat. *

*When you're lying in your bed,  
And wonder what that noise can be,  
Or see a shadow on your window   
Promenading eerily   *

*Even if you'd rather not, 
Something in you wants to know,  
And that inquisitive emotion  
Is your curiosity!*

*Why does the wind blow mostly from the westerly  
And then mostly cheerily though sometimes rather stormily,  
But when gets to blowing from the easterly  
Then it begins to snow!*

*So many things I'll never know,
learning them would be a task,
but when curiosity demands,
I never think it hurts to ask.
It only means you want to know.*

**Fiona:** I see. I wonder...

**Cornelia:** What do you wonder?

**Fiona:** If I am beginning to wonder.

*(Confrontation between Cornelia and George, because
Cornelia wants to help paint the drops)*

**George:** Now I'm telling you, Cornelia, for the last time. Leave
my brushes and paints alone. 

**Tempe:** Oh Cornelia, you're always making a nuisance of yourself.

**Cornelia:** But that's not fair.  I only want to do little painting
on the drops.

**Gearoge:** Well not you can't and that's that.

**Cornelia:** People are always treating me like a kid. But I'll show
them what I can do!

## Scene 8

*(Bob and Fiona. The meaning of home)*

**Fiona:** How do we pass the time, as you walk me home? 

**Bob:** I suppose we could talk.

**Fiona:** What shall we talk about?

**Bob:** We could talk about the moonlight.

**Fiona:** There isn't any moonlight. 

**Bob:** Isn't there? I thought there was.

**Fiona:** Look up, Bob. No moon. The sky is clear and black.
You can hear the great winds howling high above us. They might blow
the stars around the heavens. 

**Bob:** But then there is starlight. Let's talk about the starlight.

**Fiona:** What would you like to know?

**Bob:**  Like to know? Where you have been all my life, where you
came from.  You are different from any girl I've known.

**Fiona:** I thought we talking about the starlight. Where I have
been? A hundred different places. 

**Bob:** What places have you been? 

**Fiona:** Well, a place called Milan, in Italy.

**Bob:** Milan, in Italy. Are you Italian?

**Fiona:** No more than I am French or German because I lived in Lyons
or Munich. Or English because I lived in London.

**Bob:** You come from everywhere.

**Fiona:** And to come from everywhere is to come from nowhere.

**Bob:** And is nowhere home for you?

**Fiona:** Home. Home. I have heard this word, but never knew its
meaning.

**Bob:** Home. Home. It isn't just a someplace, it's a feeling.

*When you're feeling tired and lonely  
And look around to see
That  where you are is not the place
That you would choose to be,

When the world seems much too big,
And you seem  much too small,


Home is made of memories and people that you've known,
Familiar 




And you've nowhere else to go*  
And you think of somplace you were happy
You're bound to know. 


Home is someplace waiting 

*Is a home a certain neighbourhood
Or could it be a town?
Home is often both those things 

**Bob:** If you live long enough in a place it becomes home. 

**Fiona:** Is home a place to be alone?

**Bob:** Sometimes. But mostly it's a place you share with others. 

**Fiona:** So more than one person can have the same home?

**Bob:** Two...can share the same home. 

**Fiona:** I know what I want now.

**Bob:** What's that?

**Fiona:** A home. Bob, how do I find a home?


## Scene 9

*(Cornelia sneaks to the theatre to try her hand at
painting the drops)*

**Cornelia:** They ought to oil that lock. How are people supposed to 
sneak in?  

Not a soul around. Good. No one to say I can't touch this, no one to
say I can't do that. 

I'll show that George what I can do. Just a kid, am I?
I'll show them... it's awfully dark in here. Of course it is, silly.
It's night time. And I've got a lamp, good coal oil lamp. Now where are
the brushes, and where are the paints? There they are.

It's awfully dark in here. But there's nobody here. I be just fine.

I'll just set down my lamp and I'll get to work and I won't think
about ghosts. Ahh! Ghosts. There aren't any. Don't think about
ghosts Cornelia. I mean who ever heard of a haunted theatre? 

Once I start painting I'll be fine. What shall I paint? I think I'll
start with something easy. I'll paint a man on horseback. I've seen a
lot of men on horseback. I know exactly what they look like. 

Splish splash, splish, splash,  in the brown paint pot, and swish
swash back and forth and look at what you've got.

Well... it's brown. And it looks exactly... like a horse. No not really. It
doesn't look anything like a horse. It looks like a mess. 

What was that noise? It was nothing, Cornelia, nothing. You'll be just
fine as long you don't think about... ghosts...

Keep busy. What shall I paint now? The horseman! I'll give him red
breeches.

Splish, splash, splish, splash, in the red paint pot. Swash swash, up
and down and look at what you've got. 

It's a mess. Maybe if you stand back and squint. No it just looks like
a mess. 

Swish. swash, up and down and now the horse has red legs. Oh no, and 
the rider has no head.  Swish swash, better a red head than no head.

 

## Scene 10

*(Song -- Sleepless Night)*

**Oliver:** It must be stopped.

**Sarah:** What must be stopped, Oliver?

**Oliver:** This play that Bob and his friends are doing. It is iniquitous.

**Sarah:** What is the play about?

**Oliver:** How should I know?

**Sarah:** You condemn the play without knowing anything about it?

**Oliver:** It's bound to be pernicious twaddle. 

**Sarah:** Even if it is... twaddle... what's the harm in a little
twaddle? There was a time when you liked a joke yourself.

**Oliver:** Corrupting the morals of the young. Putting women on the
stage. These are dark days, and Satan is abroad in Lindsay.

**Sarah:** Oh for goodness sakes. I'm going to bed, Oliver. I wish
you would do the same. 

**Oliver:** My brother defies my wishes. Even my own wife 
will not stand with me... but I will prevail.


## Scene 11

Confrontation between Bob and Oliver over the damage
to the drops.

**Bob:** How could you do such a rotten underhanded thing, Oliver.

**Oliver:** I did nothing. 

**Bob:** We caught you. You were there.

**Oliver:** 

Song for Sarah and Oliver: Trust.

## Scene 12

Cast meeting. George: Were you ever just so mad you could spit.

**George:** All that work! Ruined!

**Fred:** We caught him red-handed. I say we go to the police. 



## Scene 13

Sarah arrives to help, and the whole cast pitches in to repair the drops.

Song: Anywhere But Here.


How lovely it would be to be
Anywhere but here. 
How splendid it would be to be
someplace that's not near.





Professor: Song: You Never Know.




## Scene 14

*(The Professor visits Oliver to persuade him to 
join the Amateurs)*

**Professor:** Ah. Here you are. It is growing dark. I'm surprised you
have not lit a lamp. How are things with you, Mr. Allen?

**Oliver:** This all your fault. 

**Professor:** Yes, you may be right.

**Oliver:** Coming into this town, where you aren't wanted.
Making trouble.

**Professor:** Things are in a state of disturbance then. Nothing is 
the way it ought to be. Something of value has been broken and how it
to be mended?

**Oliver:** You might put it that way. 

**Professor:** The others blame you for the damage to poor George's
work. I know that you are not to blame.

**Oliver:** I thank you for your good opinion. I wish my own wife
shared it.

**Professor:** Ah yes. A delightful lady, Mrs. Allen. Sarah, if I may
be so familiar. She has given me leave to call her by her first name.

**Oliver:** Her Christian name.

**Professor:** By all means. I am sorry to hear that Sarah has so
little faith in you.

**Oliver:** It's none of your business in any case.

**Professor:** Perhaps not. I seem fated to stumble in where angels 
fear to tread. You do know who did the damage.

**Oliver:** I refuse to discuss the matter.

**Professor:** That is honourable of you. It is of no importance. 
I know too. But what can be done to mend this rift between you and
Sarah?

**Oliver:** Nothing, I think. The harm is done. I had no idea her
opinion of me had sunk so low.

**Professor:** You have been married ten years, I believe.

**Oliver:** Yes.

**Professor:** And no children.

**Oliver:** No. 

**Professor:** It has not been the will of Providence.

**Oliver:** How strange to hear you speak in such terms.

**Professor:** Not quite so strange, Mr. Allen. May I call you Oliver.






## Scene 15

Bob and Fiona: Love scene. Fiona moving toward 
becoming human. Song: The Nature Of Things.

**Bob:** What shall we talk about?

**Fiona:** Do we have to talk?

**Bob:** It fills the awkward silence. We could talk about the
moonlight.

**Fiona:** But there isn't moon.

**Bob:** We could talk about the starlight.

**Fiona:** You better hurry... look... the clouds are about to cover
the last... stars. 

**Bob:** And they're gone. And now its pitch dark. Watch that you
don't stumble. Perhaps you'd better take my arm.

**Fiona:** I am doing very, thank you all the same.

**Bob:** But I might stumble. Oh never mind. I think it's up to you to
choose a topic. I have suggested two perfectly good ones already and
you have raised objections. 

**Fiona:** I think perhaps we should talk about...

**Bob:** What?

**Fiona:** The nature of things.

**Bob:** The nature of things. The wonderful, delightful, mysterious
nature of things.

**Fiona:** The topsy-turvy upside down nature of things.

**Bob:** The nature of you.

**Fiona:** The nature of you.

**Bob:**

*I could make a study of the nature of you*





## Scene 16

Last rehearsal.

## Scene 17

Fiona becomes human.  Song: What Lies Ahead?

**Professor:** The time has come, my dearest sister, for us to part.
For a while. You have made your choice. I cannot say that you were
wrong.

**Fiona:** What is this strange feeling? *(Hugs herself as if in
pain)*

**Professor:** That is pain, Fiona. It is part of being human. 

## Scene 18

The Night: Stage Fright.

*(Just before the curtain opens)*

**Bob:** I don't think this show will ever come together.

**Sarah:** Somebody told me a bad rehearsal means a good performance.

**Fred:** Never mind everybody. It'll be all right on the night.

**Tempe:** But this is the night!

**Fred:** Oh my sainted aunt. So it is!

*(song: Stage fright)*

*Just before the curtain opens   
Just before the axe descends  
Waves of panic sweep the hearts
Of all on whom the show depends.*

*Let me think now, I can't think now  
How did I get into this? 
Please lord let a hole appear and swallow me   
How do I get out of this?*

*Stage fright, stage fright, creeping down my spine   
Churning up my insides,* 



**Professor:** Tut, tut my friends. There is no reason to be alarmed.
Each of you knows his part. Simply do it and enjoy yourselves.  

**Fiona:** Seamus. I have an odd feeling in my insides. I think I am nervous. 

**Professor:** As I feared. You are becoming human. Will I lose you, Fiona?

**Fiona:** I feel awful. Seamus? Will I die?

**Professor:** Not from stage fright, Fiona. Join the others. You'll be fine. 



## Scene 19

*(Performance of Princess Myrtle. Scientific Self-Defence, The Villain,  The Hero, Instantly In Love.)*

**Oliver:** Another cup of temperance mead, junior maid! On the
double!

**Cornelia:** Yes, your majesty. Right away your majesty! On the
double your Majesty, sir!

**Tempe:** And another box of chocolate creams, Junior Maid. And you
might wash your face, while you're at it.

**Cornelia:** Yes, Princess Myrtle, anything you say Princess Myrtle.
*(goes off grumbling)* Just wait until the revolution.

**OLiver:** What is this I hear of restlessness among the people?

**Sarah:** I'm sure it is nothing, my dear. 

**Tempe:** If the people don't settle down, I'll knock them into
the next kingdom.

**Sarah:** That isn't very lady-like, Myrtle dear. What has got into you?

**Tempe:** I will tell you in one word: "Osgoode Toddie's Scientific
Self-defence For The Nineteenth Century"!  Mail order is a wonderful
thing, especially if you live in a remote kingdom that most people
have never heard of. 

*It's a rough and tumble life in a fairy tale kingdom  
And a princess has to mind her p's and q's. 
If she wants to get along then she can't be namby pamby   
Or too nice about the methods she will use.* 

*When the merry villagers aren't making merry,  
They're sharpening their scythes and looking tense.   
Then consult this handy reference, the princess's best friend,   
"Osgoode Toddie's Scientific Self-defence".*

*When a villain comes a calling he can ruin your whole day,     
With some evil scheme to gain at your expense.  
I can recommend no better guide to foiling him again: 
"Osgoode Toddie's Scientific Self-defence".*

*You may not care to read it absolutely word for word,
For I find the text itself is rather dense,
But the many illustrations will instruct you handily,
"Osgoode Toddie's Scientific Self-defence".*

**Oliver:** A villain, eh? It's been some time since we had a villain
round. Do you remember the last time, my dear?

**Sarah:** There was that odious person who claimed you owed thousands of 
dollars in back taxes, and you were going  to jail if you didn't pay
him.

**Oliver:** That was the Prime Minister. I can't think why I appointed
him. No I mean the regulation sort of villain. Black hat. Mortgage on
the kingdom, that sort of thing.

*(A loud knocking is heard off stage. Fiona as the Lady In Waiting cames in.)* 

**Fiona:** Pardon me, your Majesties. There is a person at the
drawbridge claiming to be a villain. 

**Oliver:** What does he look like?

**Fiona:** Black hat. Holding a mortgage on the kingdom.

**Tempe:** Let him in. Let in him in. I'm ready for him.

**Oliver:** Very well. Lower the drawbridge.

*(Fiona returns with Bob)*

**Fred:** Good day, your majesties. I trust I'm not arriving at an
awkward time?

**Sarah:** A considerate villain. Have you had your lunch?

**Fred:** Yes thank you, your majesty. I ate at the charming inn down
in the village. 

**Oliver:** Did you? I'm surprised to see you looking so well. That's
where we send our enemies on the eve of battle.  What can we do for you? 

**Fred:** My master has sent me to extract a large amount of cash from
you, and it please your Majesty.

**Oliver:** Your master? He's not the Prime Minister, by any chance? 

**Fred:** No, my master is the Arch Villain.

**Oliver:** Then who are you?

**Fred:** The assistant... no... the third assistant villain. 

**Tempe:** What is this? We don't even rate a first assistant villain?

**Fred:** I'm sorry about this, but we're rushed off our feet around
the shop, with so much villainy to be done, and no one wants to go
into the trades anymore. 

**Tempe:** This is pitiful.

**Fred:** Oh, indeed, indeed your Highness. Pity is the word.

*(Song The Villain)* 

Professor, please.

**Tempe:** This a long introduction. Is there a song? 

**Fred:** It's coming, it's coming. 

**Tempe:** So's Christmas.

**Fred:**

*Pity the poor villain and his strange unhappy lot,  
So universally condemned and so misunderstood  
When all he wants to do in life is hatch his evil plot,  
And on the way to do himself a little bit of good.*

*When I was just a little boy barely five years old  
My mother packed my lunch and I set off reluctantly.  
It wasn't our first choice but the nearest school you see,  
And so I went to villain school, the villain school for me.*

*Pity the poor villain and his strange unhappy lot,  
The hero wins the ladies' hearts, the hero gets the press.  
And rarely do you hear a good word said for villainy,
A victim of the public's ignorance and prejudice.*

*I read my lessons faithfully and did the things I should  
But time and time again I was sent home for being good.  
And when I did my evil laugh, the others laughed at me,
For villainy for me you see did not come naturally.*

*On leaving school I took a post, but found I lacked the drive  
For the corporate environment, I was too nice to thrive.  
And given my proclivities it should be no surprise   
That third assistant villain was as high as I would rise.*

Now, your Majesties, about that large sum of cash?

**Oliver:** But we've spent it all.

**Fred:** You've spent it all?

**Oliver:** Barrels of temperance mead aren't free. Then there's 
polishing the armour, and so on. And you have no idea what it costs to
heat this barn of of a place and put large joints of meat on the fire.

**Sarah:** Not to mention fresh straw for the floor, and the
troubadour's fees. 

**Fred:** What's a troubadour?

**Tempe:** A kind of singer-songwriter.

**Fred:**  Oh dear.  Well... it pains me to have to use harsh methods with
a nice royal family, but if you don't cough up the cash...

**Tempe:** Enough, Villain. To save my country I am prepared to
sacrifice something of priceless value... my virtue. 

**Fred:** But I am not prepared to sacrifice mine. It's cash or
nothing Princess. Do you have a railway track around here, by any
chance?

**Oliver:** Yes, there's one outside the drawbridge. You must have
stepped over it when you came in. 

**Fred:** So I did, your Majesty. Stupid. I'd forget my own head if it
wasn't bolted on.  Come along Princess Myrtle. The manual says I have
to tie you to a railway track.

**Sarah:** But a train might come along.

**Fred:** That is the idea. 

**Tempe:** I'll go quietly, villain.

**Fred:** You will? That's very sporting of you. What is that book?

**Tempe:** Osgoode Toddie's Scientific Self-Defence. 

**Fred:** I've never read it.

**Tempe:** Have you not?

**Fred:** Is it any good?

**Tempe:** We'll soon find out. 

**Cornelia:** The villain led Princess Myrtle to the rails and whipped
out a length of rope. There was a whirl of motion, a shriek, and a
high pitched scream... and the villain was neatly tied to the tracks.

**Fred:** Now let me see. That wasn't quite right.

**Tempe:** And so the villain is tied to the railroad track, and not
the heroine.

**Fred:** Yes, yes, I do see the irony. Very amusing, Now if you could
see your way clear...

**Tempe:** Hark! Was that a train whistle I heard in the distance?

**Fred:** Possibly. If you could just untie me now?

**Tempe:** Will you tear up the mortgage?

**Fred:** Oh, certainly. It doesn't belong to me anyway.

**Tempe:** And will you stop being a villain?

**Fred:** Gladly,if alternative employment could be found.

**Tempe:** And will you marry me, and be my own?

**Fred:** Oh, ah...ah.

**Tempe:** There's that whistle again, and it's getting closer.

**Fred:** What's the pay like?

**Tempe:** Prince Consort starts at two pounds five shillings a week.
We supply the uniform. 

**Fred:** That's better than I get now. I'll do it. Now hurry.

*(Princess Myrtle frees the villain)*

*(Fiona enters, followed by Bob}*

**Fiona:** Excuse me your highness. The Hero is here, about the
Villain.

**Bob:** *(Song, See The Noble Hero come)

See the noble hero come,



**Tempe:** Yes, yes. I think we did just get that.

**Bob:**
Now where is this villain? I will smite him.

**Tempe:**

There is no villain here. 

**Bob:**

Are you sure? I have a work order here for villain removal. Fairytale
kingdom, intersection of King and Queen. Are you Princess Myrtle?

**Tempe** I cannot deny it.

**Bob:** 

And that looks an awful lot like a villain.

*(Indicates Fred)*

**Fred:** Appearances are deceiving.

**Tempe:** Leave him alone, or I'll knock you into the next kingdom.

**Fred:** I'd listen to her if I were you.

**Bob:** Better leave these matters to the experts, Princess. Please 
stand aside.

**Tempe:** I warned you.

*(Bob makes a move toward Fred and Tempe "punches" Bob back into
Fiona's arms.)*

**Fiona:** Oh you poor hero.

**Bob:** I hear someone playing a harp. Am I in heaven?

**Tempe:** Not yet. Let me have another swing, and we'll see what we
can do.

**Fiona:** Leave him alone, your highness. If we patch him up he'll do
for best man at your wedding.

**Tempe:** An excellent notion. We will let him live. 

**Bob:** *(Looking at Fiona)* I think I'm in love.

**Tempe:** Marry him while he's still delerious. That's my motto.

**Oliver:** And so our story draws to a close in the traditional fairy
tale way.

**Sarah:** With a double wedding.

**Quartet:** So Instantly In Love



**Cornelia:** Sickening isn't it? That's what we get for living in a
fairy tale kingdom.  And so they lived happily ever after.  Until the
revolution! Which reminds me. There must be an opening for a third
assistant villain. *(Picks up the black hat, and bows to the audience,
with the rest of the cast doing likewise, and walks off with hat on
her head, practising her evil laugh)*

## Scene 20

The Professor takes his leave. Bob and Fiona united.  Oliver and Sarah reconciled. 


**Oliver:** Who are you?

**Professor:** Sometimes I hardly know myself. Say that I am a
traveller through this world. 

**Oliver:** With no place to come to rest?

**Professor:** No. At least...

**Oliver:** Yet even the swallow has found her nest.

**Professor:** Fiona, you mean? Yes. She has found her nest.  And
someday... yes, for me.  For the moment I have obligations, and work
laid out for me.  A world of souls to heal, one by one, and not the
least of them, my own. A daunting task. But then we have eternity
ahead of us. 

**Oliver:** Do we?

**Professor:** Yes. And we are not alone. Give me your blessing,
Oliver, servant of God, and send me merrily on my way.

**Oliver:** 

*(They shake hands)*

We will hear from you again?

**Professor:** Oh yes, from time to time. Goodbye.

*(Professor goes off leaving Oliver alone on the stage.)*

*All praise to God that gives us joy,
A gift devine.*














**Fiona:** I know you think I'm silly. 

**Bob:** No, I...

**Fiona:** There's no point in lying. I heard you talking.

**Fred:** Oh.

**Fiona:** I wouldn't mind so much except...I liked you, and I thought that maybe you liked me.

**Fred:** Oh, I do.
 
## Scene

**Professor:** What is this Fiona? Are you becoming human?

**Fiona:** How would I know, if I were?

**Professor:** I only know myself by hearsay.

  


## Scene 

## Scene

**Professor:** Ladies and Gentlemen! Lindsay's very own the reverend Mr. Oliver. 
A warm round of applause, if you please, for our special guest.

*(Everyone applauds, encouraged by the cast. Oliver is astonished, then bows to the audience.)*

A good man with a good sense of humour. 


## Scene 

## Scene 

**Bob:** So you only want to have a child. Do you love me?

**Fiona:** I think I do. But I'm not sure. What does love feel like?

**Bob:** What does love feel like? But don't you know?

**Fiona:** I...I know...but tell me anyway?

**Bob:** It's not something you can put into words. You can't say what
something feels like. 

**Fiona:** There are words for everything.

**Bob:** Not for everything. Love begins where words leave off.

**Fiona:** Then how can I ever know. 




## Scene

**Oliver:** Why, Professor. It's you. Are you still in town?

**Professor:** Yes. Why the surprise?

**Oliver:** I somehow had the impression that you were leaving us?

**Professor:** No. We've have led something of a wandering existence,
my sister and I, but now...

**Oliver:** Now that the bird has made her nest?

**Professor:** Just so. I will make my nest here too. And my music
too. I understand that you will soon need another organist. 

**Oliver:** Do you play the organ too?

**Proessor:** Oh indeed. The nobelest of intruments, the organ, is it
not?

**Oliver:** There are some of my congregation that would be happier
with no intruments at all in the church, but yes... I agree with you.
Perhaps you would like to come to the church and try the instrument?
I would have to get the boy to come and pump for you... perhaps
tomorrow afternoon?

**Professor:** Admirable. 

**Oliver:** I was just turning home for supper. Would you like to come
and take pot luck with us? Sarah would be glad to see you. She is...
she is... expecting you know.

**Professor:** Expecting what? Oh...my goodness. Congratulations.

**Oliver:** As for the meal, I make no promises. Cornelia has been
gooking for us, now that Sarah is sometimes indisposed.

**Professor:** I have an iron constitution. 

**Oliver:** Good, good.

**Professor:** I understand you used to play a capital game of
draughts...checkers I believe you call it.

**Oliver:** What you mean used to play?

**Professor:** Bob seemed to think you might be a little rusty.

**Oliver:** I'll show you hao rusty I am, if you would care to try?

**Professor:** I would. 



## Scene 

*(Cornelia comes on carrying two metal buckets "of paint")*

**Cornelia:** And so they all lived happily ever after.

**George:** *(Off)* Cornelia! Where the heck is that paint? I swear
you're as slow as molasses in January!

**Cornelia:** Until the revolution!

End Notes

Oliver come just after Sarah to help with painting the drops 
and Sarah accidently spills a can of paint on him. She is aghast but
Oliver begins to laugh.  

**Professor:** *(To Fiona)* Was that your doing?

**Fiona:** No Seamus, I thought is was yours.

**Professor:** They must have done it themselves. Perfect.
