<h1 id="act-1">Act 1</h1>
<h2 id="scene-1">Scene 1</h2>
<p><em>A silent hall, an empty stage<br />
A group of friends with but one thought.<br />
“Let’s do a play” is soon the cry,<br />
And no one thinks to say “let’s not”.</em></p>
<p><em>What sound out front now stirs the heart?<br />
And strikes the bowels with consternation?<br />
Is that the murmur of the crowd,<br />
Waiting in anticipation?</em></p>
<p><em>Too late now for fond regrets,<br />
No turning back to days of old.<br />
The die is cast, our fate is sealed,<br />
The seats are filled, the tickets sold.</em></p>
<p><em>That pistol now must be discharged<br />
Halfway through the second act.<br />
Evil must be foiled again,<br />
And once again next week in fact.</em></p>
<p><em>That secret letter intercepted<br />
(ruin to someone most respected);<br />
Oh Papa dear, what shall we do?<br />
Cries Maiden with a heart so true.</em></p>
<p><em>Then Villain with a black moustache<br />
Sneers his sneer and laughs his laugh.<br />
And Maiden with a heart so pure<br />
Knows well what she must endure!</em></p>
<p><em>But hark! Oh hark, what do I hear?<br />
Could those be hoof beats drawing near?<br />
Like coconuts on table top<br />
Drawing nearer, then they stop.</em></p>
<p><em>The door flies open with a bang<br />
(That comes a half a second late)<br />
And Hero bold with steely gaze<br />
Strides in and stands to wait… and wait.</em></p>
<p><em>Some nervous laughter then a thoughtful<br />
Person whispers Hero’s line.<br />
And Villain meets his nemesis,<br />
The day is saved and all is fine.</em></p>
<p><em>The Merry Villagers have sung,<br />
The cast have made their curtain calls.<br />
The audience, with bottoms numb,<br />
Prepares to rise, the curtain falls.</em></p>
<h2 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h2>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Poor old Lindsay’s going to the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> I said Lindsay’s going to the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Spare me, Fred, for goodness sake. It’s Monday morning and my head is fogged.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Why is that? You’ve had a day of rest to clear your head.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Day of rest, my foot. The boy that pumps the church organ has the mumps. Guess who had to pump the organ instead. Two services, morning and evening.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Good bracing exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> And I had two solos to sing as well.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> How’d you manage that?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Stuck my head around to sing and kept pumping.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> No one can say you aren’t versatile, Bob. At least you had your afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I teach Sunday school. And lead the junior choir.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> You ought to find a nice girl and move out out of your brother’s house. Make a life of your own, my boy. Then maybe he wouldn’t rope you into doing everything.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I’d have to move out to the Cariboo. Anyway, I like Lindsay. We’re not going to dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> We’ve gotten as dull as Peterborough on a market day.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> We can’t be that bad. Dominion day this year was a corker. We had a hot air balloon.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Which caught fire…and went down instead of up.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> You can’t say that wasn’t exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Especially for the poor souls on the balloon.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> No one was hurt. Then a torchlight parade with the fire brigade and the band.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yes, yes, but that was ages ago. What we done since? We’re all growing thin and melancholy for lack of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I don’t lack for entertainment. Obadiah often reads to us from a book of sermons.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh for the wings of a dove!</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sometimes my sister-in-law plays the harmonium and we sing a few hymns.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Death, where is thy sting?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> There’s nothing wrong with hymns. Why after a few hymns I’m ready for… ready for…</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Some entertainment. The whole town is pining for amusement and there… there is Bell’s music hall standing dark, its stage empty and lifeless… but waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Waiting?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Waiting for what? <em>(Wary)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Waiting for a pistol shot! Waiting for a scream. Waiting for song from you, and dance from me. Waiting for a sword fight, true lovers united, and a final chorus from the merry villagers. In short, waiting for us!</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh no. <em>(Starts to walk away and Fred pulls him back)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> I didn’t mean just you and me. No, no. We’ll get some others to join us. We’ll put on some entertainments that will make this town stand up.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> And throw rotten fruit. Fred, we’re amateurs.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> We’re amateurs of course! We’ll call ourselves the Amateurs! Those that love the theatre. Those that love the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Those that work and don’t get paid. This is just another of your hare-brained schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Not guilty. The Professor suggested it.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Who is the Professor?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> You haven’t met the Professor? He’s new in town, a master musician and teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Uh huh. How are you going to pay for all this?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> At present our funds amount to seven dollars and fifty-five cents.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> A princely sum.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Eight dollars and fifty-five cents if you pay me the dollar you owe me. i</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> You’ll have to scrape together a little more than that for a lease on the music hall.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Not to mention canvas and pots of paint for George Wright. But we’ll find the money.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> What’s George doing?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> The creative fire is burning in his soul. He’s going to paint our backdrops. And wait until you meet the Professor. He’s a musical genius. Straight from Leipzig, or Paris, or one of those places.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> It’s all very well, Fred. I have to admit it sounds like fun. But Obadiah would have an apoplexy if I told him I was going on the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Holy Obadiah.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yes. I can hear him now.</p>
<p>Song: “Go To The Theatre”</p>
<p><em>If you would imbibe false views,<br />
go to the theatre!<br />
Idle fancy to amuse,<br />
go to the theatre<br />
If salvation you’d refuse,<br />
your immortal soul you’d lose,<br />
Fill the Church Of Satan’s pews!<br />
Go to the theatre!</em></p>
<p><em>If you look for lewdity,<br />
go to the theatre!<br />
Rubbish, twaddle, nudity,<br />
got to the theatre!<br />
Beelzebub will take your fees,<br />
Take whatever seat you please.<br />
Sit with Mephistopheles!<br />
Go to the theatre!</em></p>
<p><em>If you would pervert your taste,<br />
go to the theatre.<br />
If in hell fire you would baste,<br />
go to the theatre!<br />
Degrading and pernicious rot<br />
paves the road to regions hot.<br />
Bishop Wood says better not<br />
go to the theatre!</em></p>
<p><em>(Spoken)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Pass by the theatre with averted gaze, for there lies the house of the strange woman! <em>(Points to upstage)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> It does?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> So I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Interesting.</p>
<p><em>(They turn to go upstage, and then turn back to the audience)</em></p>
<p><em>(Together)</em></p>
<p><em>What’s this twaddle all about?<br />
Step right up, remove all doubt.<br />
Go inside and you’ll find out!<br />
Go to the theatre!</em></p>
<p><em>(They go off)</em></p>
<h2 id="scene">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> I beg your pardon, Professor, but I was not flat.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> But my dear, by the piano…</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> Your piano is out of tune.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> It is comparatively rare, though not unknown, for a piano to go sharp, Tempe. In any case the piano was most carefully tuned only two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> But, but…</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> On the other hand it is comparatively common for a singer to be flat. I don’t know why that should be, but there it is. Who are to rail against the laws of nature? Or perhaps we should say the force of gravity. Let calm acceptance be our watchword. And let us work, Tempe, work. Try it again from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> <em>(Stage whisper to audience)</em> It was the piano.</p>
<p><em>Oh that I might chance to be<br />
A nightingale upon a tree<br />
Chirping, yodelling merrily<br />
Just outside your window.</em></p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Warbling, Tempe, not yodelling.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> I beg your pardon Professor, but I’m sure it is yodelling.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Look at the words, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> Oh. This must be a new edition.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> It was always warbling, Tempe. Have you ever heard a nightingale yodel?</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> We don’t have nightingales in Canada. I don’t know if they chirp or warble. I don’t know what they do. Why can’t we sing about woodpeckers, or chickadees?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> From the beginning, Tempe, please.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong></p>
<p><em>(Struggling)</em></p>
<p><em>Oh that I might chance to be<br />
A nightingale upon a tree<br />
Chirping, warbling merrily<br />
Just outside your window.</em></p>
<p><em>And if awhile you did remain,<br />
Listening to my sad refrain,<br />
You I’m sure would not complain<br />
And loudly close your window.</em></p>
<p><em>For well you know my heart is pure<br />
And nothing but your love can cure<br />
This suffering I must endure<br />
While singing at your window.</em></p>
<p>These words don’t make much sense.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Certainly not. That is what we call poetry, Tempe. By courtesy. The words suffered a little I admit in translation from the German.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> If you say so, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> That is our time for this week I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> Am I getting better, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> These things take time.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> That means I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Why do you want to sing, Tempe?</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> I don’t know. Not to say it in words.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> I don’t mean to know in words. When you know in your heart, then you will sing well as only you can sing.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> Thank you, Professor. I think.</p>
<p><em>(Tempe leaves and Bella enters)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> They are all the same, these pupils. The same faults, the same struggle. The same hopes. The same despair.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> No, Bella, they are all different, as every face is different. That is the fascination of teaching. The more I travel through this world, the more I treasure differences.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> And yet we are not of this world, you and I. How can we treasure anything? Ever moving. Never holding on to anything.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> It is our lot, my dear sister. Let us find what interest we can in the passing scene, we wandering ones. And yet remember, we are not without purpose in our existence.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong></p>
<p><em>(The doorbell rings)</em></p>
<p>Ah, that may be our young friends, the Amateurs. Would you go and see them in, Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong></p>
<p>The what, Irwin?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong></p>
<p>The Amateurs.</p>
<p><em>(Bella goes off while the Professor shuffles through some music. Bella returns with Fred and Bob)</em></p>
<p>Ah, gentlemen. Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p><em>(Fred looks around with interest at the room, while Bob looks with interest at Bella.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Thanks Professor. I’ve brought my friend Bob along. I told you about Bob. The one that can carry a tune.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Indeed you did. <em>(Notices Bob looking at Bella)</em> Oh, may I present my sister, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> So, you can carry a tune, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Just barely.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Modesty is a virtue.</p>
<h2 id="scene-3">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Bob. Someone has told me… I can scarcely believe it… that you intend to go upon… the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, yes, Obadiah. As a matter of fact, ah… the thought had…ah… occurred to me. I meant to tell you. You see, Fred thought we were in need of some harmless…</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Harmless!</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> and perfectly wholesome entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Perfectly wholesome? Bob, you must be mad. Theatres are cages of uncleanness and public schools of debauchery. They are seminaries of vice!</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> How did you discover that? I didn’t know you had ever gone into a theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Providence forbid! No, I trust to the opinions universally expressed by the greatest men in all ages. Men like Augustine, and Tertullian.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Who were regular theatre goers?</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Yes, Bob, scoff. I suppose I don’t deserve anything better.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, Obadiah. Some harmless entertainment. What’s wrong with a little fun?</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Your immortal soul is not in need of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> No but my earthly form is finding things a little dull.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It seems all my words, the good example I have tried to set have been cast away, while you go to disport yourself among the heathen and the blasphemers.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Heathen and blasphemers? A respectable group of amateurs, most of them regular church-goers. And Bell’s music hall. Hardly a palace of riot and debauchery, Obadiah. A decent and ah… virtuous group of men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Women! Heaven defend us from all the wiles of Satan! Surely you do not propose to put women on the stage?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> The thought had had occurred. You see there are so many parts for women, and if you’ve ever seen Fred in a wig, well it’s not something you want to see again.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Depravity is not a joking matter. This all the result of keeping low company. This Fred…</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Obadiah, you’ve made your point. Let’s disagree, but still be brothers. <em>(Bob offers Obadiah his hand, but Obadiah ignores it. Bob walks sadly away.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Harmless fun. So much harm may come from harmless fun.</p>
<h2 id="scene-4">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> I know that Bella sings. Does she act as well?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Does she act? Why she had the audience in tears when she played “Little Pickle” in the well known play of the same name. That was in our time in England.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Do you think you could persuade her to join our company? We can’t afford to pay her.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> I’m sure she would be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> What part might we give her, do you suppose? I thinking of the Princess Myrtle.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> But our good friend Tempe has been singing the part in rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> But the princess ought to be so, so… and Tempe is so, so…</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Tempe would be terribly disappointed to have it taken away from her.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> What importance is the disappointment of one when the needs of art are question?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> What importance are the needs of art when the disappointment of one is in question?</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> You are a curious man, Professor. I thought you would place art above everything.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> There are many arts that one can practise, Fred. Bella would be charming as the maid. A comic part and one good song.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> All right, Professor. You know best.</p>
<h2 id="scene-5">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It must be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> What must be stopped, Obadiah?</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> This play that Bob and his friends are doing. It is iniquitous.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> What is the play about?</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> You condemn the play without knowing anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It’s bound to be pernicious twaddle.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Even if it is… twaddle… what’s the harm in a little twaddle? There was a time when you liked a joke yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Corrupting the morals of the young. Putting women on the stage. These are dark days, and Satan is abroad in Lindsay.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Oh for goodness sakes. <em>(Walks off)</em></p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> My brother defies my wishes. Even my own wife will not stand with me… but I will prevail.</p>
<h2 id="scene-6">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I know you think I’m silly.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> No, I…</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> There’s no point in lying. I heard you talking.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I wouldn’t mind so much except…I liked you, and I thought that maybe you liked me.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh, I do.</p>
<h2 id="scene-7">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> What is this Bella? Are you becoming human?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> How would I know, if I were?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> I only know myself by hearsay.</p>
<h2 id="scene-8">Scene</h2>
<p><em>(Just before the curtain opens)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I don’t think this show will ever come together.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Somebody told me a bad rehearsal means a good performance.</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Never mind everybody. It’ll be all right on the night.</p>
<p><strong>Tempe:</strong> But this is the night!</p>
<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh my sainted aunt. So it is!</p>
<p><em>(song: Stage fright)</em></p>
<p><em>Just before the curtain opens<br />
Just before the axe descends<br />
Waves of panic sweep the hearts Of all on whom the show depends.</em></p>
<p><em>Let me think now, I can’t think now<br />
How did I get into this? Please lord let a hole appear and swallow me<br />
How do I get out of this?</em></p>
<p><em>Stage fright, stage fright, creeping down my spine<br />
Churning up my insides,</em></p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Tut, tut my friends. There is no reason to be alarmed. Each of you knows his part. Simply do it and enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Irwin. I have an odd feeling in my insides. I think I am nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> As I feared. You are becoming human. Will I lose you, Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I feel awful. Irwin? Will I die?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Not from stage fright, Bella. Join the others. You’ll be fine.</p>
<h2 id="scene-9">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Ladies and Gentlemen! Lindsay’s very own the reverend Mr. Obadiah. A warm round of applause, if you please, for our special guest.</p>
<p><em>(Everyone applauds, encouraged by the cast. Obadiah is astonished, then bows to the audience.)</em></p>
<p>A good man with a good sense of humour.</p>
<h2 id="scene-10">Scene</h2>
<p><em>(Bob and Bella)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> How do we pass the time, as you walk me home?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I suppose we could talk.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> What shall we talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> We could talk about the moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> There isn’t any moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Isn’t there? I thought there was.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Look up, Bob. No moon. The sky is clear and black. You can hear the great winds howling high above us. They might blow the stars around the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> But then there is starlight. Let’s talk about the starlight.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> What would you like to know?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Like to know? Where you have been all my life, where you came from. You are different from any girl I’ve known.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I thought we talking about the starlight. Where I have been? A hundred different places.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> What places have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Well, a place called Milan, in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Milan, in Italy. Are you Italian?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> No more than I am French or German because I lived in Lyons or Munich. Or English because I lived in London.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> You come from everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> And to come from everywhere is to come from nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> And is nowhere home for you?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Home. Home. I have heard this word, but never knew its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Home. Home. It isn’t just a someplace, it’s a feeling.</p>
<p><em>When you’re feeling tired and lonely<br />
And you’ve nowhere else to go</em><br />
And you think of somplace you were happy You’re bound to know.</p>
<p><em>When the world is much too large for you</em> When you’re feeling much too small*</p>
<p>Home is someplace waiting</p>
<p>*Is a home a certain neighbourhood Or could it be a town? Home is often both those things</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Is home a place to be alone?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sometimes. But mostly it’s a place you share with others.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> So more than one person can have the same home?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Two…can share the same home.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I know what I want now.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> A home. Bob, how do I find a home?</p>
<h2 id="scene-11">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> So you only want to have a child. Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I think I do. But I’m not sure. What does love feel like?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> What does love feel like? But don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> I…I know…but tell me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> It’s not something you can put into words. You can’t say what something feels like.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> There are words for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Not for everything. Love begins where words leave off.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> Then how can I ever know.</p>
<h2 id="scene-12">Scene</h2>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Sometimes I hardly know myself. Say that I am a traveller through this world.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> With no place to come to rest?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> No. At least…</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Yet even the swallow has found her nest.</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Bella, you mean? Yes. She has found her nest. And someday… yes, for me. For the moment I have obligations, and work laid out for me. A world of souls to heal, one by one, and not the least of them, my own. A daunting task. But then we have eternity ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong> Do we?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Yes. And we are not alone. Give me your blessing, Obadiah, servant of God, and send me merrily on my way.</p>
<p><strong>Obadiah:</strong></p>
<p><em>(They shake hands)</em></p>
<p>We will hear from you again?</p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Oh yes, from time to time. Goodbye.</p>
<p><em>(Professor goes off leaving Obadiah alone on the stage.)</em></p>
<p><em>All praise to God that gives us joy, A gift devine.</em></p>
<h2 id="scene-13">Scene</h2>
<p><em>(Near end)</em></p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> The time has come, my dearest sister, for us to part. For a while. You have made your choice. I cannot say that you were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Bella:</strong> What is this strange feeling? <em>(Hugs herself as if in pain)</em></p>
<p><strong>Professor:</strong> That is pain, Bella. It is part of being human.</p>
